/**
 * Utilities for manipulating the typescript typechecker.
 *
 * @remarks
 * Note: much of this library (the variance parts)
 * will be able to be replaced with Typescript 4.7 explicit variance annotations.
 *
 * Typescript uses structural typing if there are no private or protected members,
 * and variance of generic type parameters depends on their usages.
 * Thus when trying to constrain code by adding extra type information,
 * it often fails to actually constrain as desired, and these utilities can help with those cases.
 *
 * This library is designed so that the desired variance can be documented in a way that is easy to read, concise,
 * and allows easy navigation to documentation explaining what is being done
 * for readers who are not familiar with this library.
 * Additionally it constrains the types so the undesired usage patterns will not compile,
 * and will give somewhat intelligible errors.
 *
 * Additionally this library provides the tools needed to test that the type constraints are working as expected,
 * or test any other similar typing constraints in an application.
 *
 * This library assumes you are compiling with --strictFunctionTypes:
 * (Covariance and Contravariance is explained along with how these helpers cause it in typescript at this link)
 * {@link https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-2-6.html#strict-function-types}.
 * If compiled with a TypeScript configuration that is not strict enough for these features to work,
 * the test suite should fail to build.
 *
 * Classes in typescript by default allow all assignments:
 * its only though adding members that any type constraints actually get applied.
 * This library provides types that can be used on a protected member of a class to add the desired constraints.
 *
 * Typical usages (use one field like this at the top of a class):
 * ```typescript
 * protected _typeCheck?: MakeNominal;
 * protected _typeCheck?: Contravariant<T>;
 * protected _typeCheck?: Covariant<T>;
 * protected _typeCheck?: Invariant<T>;
 * protected _typeCheck?: Contravariant<T> & Invariant<K>;
 * ```
 *
 * See tests for examples.
 *
 * Note that all of these cause nominal typing.
 * If constraints on generic type parameter variance are desired, but nominal typing is not,
 * these types can be used on a public field. This case also works with interfaces.
 *
 * Be aware that other members of your type might apply further constraints
 * (ex: you might try and write a Contravariant<T> class, but it ends up being Invariant<T> due to a field of type T).
 *
 * Be aware of TypeScript Bug:
 * {@link https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/36906}.
 * This bug is why the fields here are protected not private.
 * Note that this bug is closed as a duplicate of {@link https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/20979}
 * which was closed because fixing it would be too large of a breaking change.
 * Thus we expect this bug to be part of TypeScript for the forseeable future.
