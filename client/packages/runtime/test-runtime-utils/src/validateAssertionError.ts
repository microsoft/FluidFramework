/**
 * Validates that an error thrown by our assert() function has the expected message, or a
 * short code that corresponds to that message.
 *
 * @remarks
 * The main use case for this is so tests that expect specific assert() calls to fail can
 * always do comparisons based on the original string message, and work whether they run
 * before the policy-check tool replaces those strings with short codes, or after. Note that
 * it either returns true or throws an error (the behavior expected by NodeJS' `assert.throws()`).
 *
 * @param error - The error object thrown by our `assert()` function. Its `message` property could
 * be a short code, or the original string message coded into the `asert()`.
 * @param expectedErrorMessage - The message that the error object should match (either explicitly,
 * or because it contains a short code which maps to that message).
 * @returns `true` if the message in the error object that was passed in matches the expected
 * message. Otherwise it throws an error.
