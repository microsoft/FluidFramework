# @fluid-internal/test-service-load

_Note: This tool has dependencies on Microsoft-internal systems._

NodeJs-based test to simulate many clients and a high rate of op generation.

## Pre-requisites

* Run [getkeys](/tools/getkeys/README.md) at some point to enable your machine to retrieve required OAuth tokens and passwords.
_You do not need to run it more than once, it will persist the keys for future sessions._
* If you are using a username not already present in `testConfig.json`,
then you'll need to add the password to the `login__odsp__test__accounts` environment variable. The format is simple:

```json
{"user@foo.com": "pwd_foo", "user@bar.com": "pwd_bar", ...}
```

If you intend to check in the new username, please reach out to someone on the team who can add the creds to Azure Key Vault.

## Usage

This package runs in two different modes: Orchestrator Mode and Test Runner mode

### Orchestrator Mode

_This is the main entry point to the test - this Orchestrator process will spawn many Test Runner processes._

```bash
node ./dist/nodeStressTest.js [--url <url>] [--tenant <tenant>] [--profile <profile>] [--debug] [--log <filterTerm>]
```

### Test Runner Mode

_This is not typically invoked manually - rather, the Orchestrator process spawns Test Runners using this mode._
_See the call to `child_process.spawn` in the source code to refer to arguments used to launch in this mode_

### npm scripts

There are several npm scripts in [package.json](./package.json) to make it quicker to launch this tool. Among others:
`npm run start` - Launches in Orchestrator Mode with default options
`npm run debug` - Debugs in Orchestrator Mode with `--debug` provided to allow for attaching to child test runners.

### URL

When running the stress tests, there will be a URL printed in console, after the line "Connecting to new Container targeting with url:".
This URL can be passed as-is to Fluid Debugger as well as fetch-tool.

### Options

#### --driver, -d

Specifies which test driver to use: odsp, routerlicious, tinylicious. The config for the drivers is pulled from the environment. See [Test Driver](../test-drivers/README.md).

#### --driverEndpoint, -e

Specifies which endpoint of test driver to use: odsp, odsp-df for odsp driver or frs, r11s, docker for routerlicious driver.

#### --profile, -p

Specifies which test profile to use from [testConfig.json](./testConfig.json). Defaults to **ci**.

#### --testId, -id

If present, the test will load an existing data store for the given test id rather than creating a new container and data store.
(Required when `--runId` is provided)

#### --runId, -r

If present, launch in Test Runner mode with the given runId (to distinguish from other concurrent test runners).
`--url` is required, since the test runner needs to know which data store to connect to.

#### --debug, -dbg

Launches each test runner with `--inspect-brk` and a unique Node debugging port. (Not compatible with `--runId`)

#### --createTestId	

If the `testId` argument is specified, the `createTestId` flag determines whether to load an exisiting
document corresponding to the `testId` specified, or create a new one. When `createTestId` is set to true,
a new document is created, and when `createTestId` is false, we try to load an existing document.

#### --log, -l

Overrides DEBUG environment variable for telemetry logging to console.
If DEBUG env variable is unset and this is not provided, only errors will print.
The value passed here should be a filter string for the logger namespace.

>To print all messages, provide `--log '*'` or `--log 'fluid:*'`. For example, to filter to only Container logs,
provide something like: `-l 'fluid:telemetry:Container:*'`.
