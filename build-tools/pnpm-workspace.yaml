# This is the workspace definition for the build-tools release group. See https://pnpm.io/pnpm-workspace_yaml for more
# information about the format.
#
# Guidelines for updating this file:
#
# 1. Keep the entries alphabetical wherever possible.
# 2. DO NOT end a glob with "**". E.g. "packages/**". Doing so can include unexpected packages. This is especially true
#    of packages for which we build ESM and CJS. Such packages sometimes have package.json files in their source or
#    output directories during compilation.

packages:
  - "packages/*"

# Supply chain security settings - see /DEV.md for documentation
