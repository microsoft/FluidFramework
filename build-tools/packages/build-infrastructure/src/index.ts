/**
 * This is the main entrypoint to the build-infrastructure API.
 *
 * The primary purpose of this package is to provide a common way to organize npm packages into groups called release
 * groups, and leverages workspaces functionality provided by package managers like npm, yarn, and pnpm to manage
 * interdependencies between packages across a BuildProject. It then provides APIs to select, filter, and work with
 * those package groups.
