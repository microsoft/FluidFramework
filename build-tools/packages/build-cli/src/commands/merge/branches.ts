1. Acknowledge the pull request by adding a comment -- "Actively working on it".
2. Merge ${mergeBranch} into the target branch, ${target}. **The direction of the merge matters!** You need to checkout ${target} and merge ${mergeBranch} into it, then fast-forward ${mergeBranch} to the merge commit. To do that use the following git commands:
  - \`git fetch --all\` -- this ensures your remote refs are updated
  - \`git remote -v\` -- displays the list of remote repositories associated with your Git repository along with their corresponding URLs. You have to choose the remote associated with the **microsoft/FluidFramework** repository. Change the remote name in these example commands if yours is not ${remote}.
  - \`git checkout -b ${tempTarget} ${remote}/${target}\` -- make a temporary branch at ${target}.
  - \`git merge ${remote}/${mergeBranch}\` -- merge ${target} into ${mergeBranch}
3. Resolve any merge conflicts between the branches, then commit all the changes using the following commands:
  - \`git add .\` -- stage all the local changes
  - \`git commit -m "${prTitle}"\` -- commit the merge
4. Fast-forward the ${mergeBranch} branch to the merge commit and push to the remote.
  - \`git checkout ${mergeBranch}\` -- check out the mergeBranch locally
  - \`git merge ${tempTarget} --ff-only\` -- fast-forward to the merge commit
  - \`git push upstream\` -- and push it to upstream (your upstream remote name may be different)
5. Address any CI failures. If you need to make additional changes to the PR, **always amend the commit** using the following git commands:
  - \`git commit --amend -m "${prTitle}"\`
