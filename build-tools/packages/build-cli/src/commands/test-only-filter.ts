/**
 * This command is used to test the common package filtering and selection logic that is used across the CLI. It
 * subclasses PackageCommand and outputs JSON containing metadata about the packages selected and filtered. This output
 * is parsed in tests.
 *
 * It may not be obvious why these command-level tests are needed in addition to testing the functions that do most of
 * the filtering (see ../filter.test.ts). The reason is that the code to translate oclif's flags into selection/filter
 * objects lives in the PackageCommand command. There's no way (that I know of) to mock an oclif command's flags.
 *
 * Instead, this test command is a real command, and the tests call it using the oclif command test infrastructure. This
 * ensures that we are testing the complete pipeline from command flag parsing, to creating selection/filter objects
 * from the flags, through applying to those filters to the packages in the repo.
 *
 * While the --json flag is technically optional, it should always be passed when using this command for testing.
 * Otherwise there is no output to be checked for correctness.
