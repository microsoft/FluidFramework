 * A policy handler that checks for JavaScript source files that just use the .js file extension. Such files may be
 * interpreted by node as either CommonJS or ESM based on the `type` field in the nearest package.json file. This
 * can create unexpected behavior for JS files; changing the package.json nearest to one will change how the JS
 * is processed by node. Using explicit file extensions reduces ambiguity and ensures a CJS file isn't suddenly treated
 * like an ESM file.
