## `flub bump PACKAGE_OR_RELEASE_GROUP`

Bumps the version of a release group or package to the next minor, major, or patch version.

```
USAGE
  $ flub bump [PACKAGE_OR_RELEASE_GROUP] [-t major|minor|patch | --exact <value>] [--scheme
    semver|internal|virtualPatch | ] [-x | --install | --commit |  |  | ] [-v]

ARGUMENTS
  PACKAGE_OR_RELEASE_GROUP  The name of a package or a release group.

FLAGS
  -t, --bumpType=<option>  Bump the release group or package to the next version according to this bump type.
                           <options: major|minor|patch>
  -v, --verbose            Verbose logging.

  --[no-]commit            Commit changes to a new branch.
  --exact=<value>          An exact string to use as the version. The string must be a valid semver string.
  --[no-]install           Update lockfiles by running 'npm install' automatically.
  --scheme=<option>        Override the version scheme used by the release group or package.
                           <options: semver|internal|virtualPatch>

DESCRIPTION
  Bumps the version of a release group or package to the next minor, major, or patch version.

  The bump command is used to bump the version of a release groups or individual packages within the repo. Typically
  this is done as part of the release process (see the release command), but it is sometimes useful to bump without
  doing a release.

EXAMPLES
  Bump @fluidframework/build-common to the next minor version.

    $ flub bump @fluidframework/build-common -t minor

  Bump the server release group to the next major version, forcing the semver version scheme.

    $ flub bump server -t major --scheme semver

  By default, the bump command will run npm install in any affected packages and commit the results to a new branch.
  You can skip these steps using the --no-commit and --no-install flags.

    $ flub bump server -t major --no-commit --no-install
```
