## `flub release`

Releases a package or release group.

```
USAGE

      --[no-]commit            Commit changes to a new branch.
      --[no-]install           Update lockfiles by running 'npm install' automatically.
      --[no-]policyCheck       Check that the local repo complies with all policy.
      --[no-]updateCheck       Check that the local repo is up to date with the remote.

LOGGING FLAGS
  -v, --verbose  Enable verbose logging.
      --quiet    Disable all logging.

DESCRIPTION
  Releases a package or release group.

  The release command ensures that a release branch is in good condition, then walks the user through releasing a
  package or release group.

  The command runs a number of checks automatically to make sure the branch is in a good state for a release. If any of
  the dependencies are also in the repo, then they're checked for the latest release version. If the dependencies have
  not yet been released, then the command prompts to perform the release of the dependency, then run the release command
  again.

  This process is continued until all the dependencies have been released, after which the release group itself is
  released.

## `flub release fromTag TAG`

Determines release information based on a git tag argument.

```
USAGE
  $ flub release fromTag TAG [--json] [-v | --quiet]

ARGUMENTS
  TAG  A git tag that represents a release. May begin with 'refs/tags/'.

LOGGING FLAGS
  -v, --verbose  Enable verbose logging.
      --quiet    Disable all logging.

GLOBAL FLAGS
  --json  Format output as json.

DESCRIPTION
  Determines release information based on a git tag argument.

  This command is used in CI to determine release information when a new release tag is pushed.

EXAMPLES
  Get release information based on a git tag.

    $ flub release fromTag build-tools_v0.13.0

  You can include the refs/tags/ part of a tag ref.

    $ flub release fromTag refs/tags/2.0.0-internal.2.0.2
```

_See code: [src/commands/release/fromTag.ts](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/blob/main/build-tools/packages/build-cli/src/commands/release/fromTag.ts)_

## `flub release history`

Prints a list of released versions of a package or release group. Releases are gathered from the git tags in repo containing the working directory.

```
USAGE
  $ flub release history [--json] [-v | --quiet] [-g client|server|azure|build-tools|gitrest|historian | -p <value>]
    [-l <value>]

FLAGS
  -g, --releaseGroup=<option>  Name of a release group.
                               <options: client|server|azure|build-tools|gitrest|historian>
  -l, --limit=<value>          Limits the number of displayed releases for each release group. Results are sorted by
                               semver, so '--limit 10' will return the 10 highest semver releases for the release group.
  -p, --package=<value>        Name of package. You can use scoped or unscoped package names. For example, both
                               @fluid-tools/benchmark and benchmark are valid.

LOGGING FLAGS
  -v, --verbose  Enable verbose logging.
      --quiet    Disable all logging.

GLOBAL FLAGS
  --json  Format output as json.

DESCRIPTION
  Prints a list of released versions of a package or release group. Releases are gathered from the git tags in repo
  containing the working directory.

  Use 'npm view' to list published packages based on the public npm registry.

  The number of results can be limited using the --limit argument.

EXAMPLES
  List all the releases of the azure release group.

    $ flub release history -g azure

  List the 10 most recent client releases.

    $ flub release history -g client --limit 10
```

_See code: [src/commands/release/history.ts](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/blob/main/build-tools/packages/build-cli/src/commands/release/history.ts)_

## `flub release report`

Generates a report of Fluid Framework releases.

```
USAGE
  $ flub release report [--json] [-v | --quiet] [-i | -r | -s] [-g
    client|server|azure|build-tools|gitrest|historian] [-o <value>] [--baseFileName <value>]

FLAGS
  -g, --releaseGroup=<option>
      Report only on this release group. If also pass --interactive, --highest, or --mostRecent, then the report will only
      include this release group at the selected version.

      If you pass this flag by itself, the command will use the version of the release group at the current commit in the
      repo, but will also include its direct Fluid dependencies.

      If you want to report on a particular release, check out the git tag for the release version you want to report on
      before running this command.
      <options: client|server|azure|build-tools|gitrest|historian>

  -i, --interactive
      Choose the version of each release group and package to contain in the release report.

  -o, --output=<value>
      Output JSON report files to this directory.

  -r, --mostRecent
      Always pick the most recent version as the latest (ignore semver version sorting).

  -s, --highest
      Always pick the greatest semver version as the latest (ignore dates).

  --baseFileName=<value>
      If provided, the output files will be named using this base name followed by the report kind (caret, simple, full,
      tilde) and the .json extension. For example, if baseFileName is 'foo', the output files will be named
      'foo.caret.json', 'foo.simple.json', etc.

LOGGING FLAGS
  -v, --verbose  Enable verbose logging.
      --quiet    Disable all logging.

GLOBAL FLAGS
  --json  Format output as json.

DESCRIPTION
  Generates a report of Fluid Framework releases.

  The release report command is used to produce a report of all the packages that were released and their version. After
  a release, it is useful to generate this report to provide to customers, so they can update their dependencies to the
  most recent version.

  The command operates in two modes: "whole repo" or "release group." The default mode is "whole repo." In this mode,
  the command will look at the git tags in the repo to determine the versions, and will include all release groups and
  packages in the repo. You can control which version of each package and release group is included in the report using
  the --interactive, --mostRecent, and --highest flags.

  The "release group" mode can be activated by passing a --releaseGroup flag. In this mode, the specified release
  group's version will be loaded from the repo, and its immediate Fluid dependencies will be included in the report.
  This is useful when we want to include only the dependency versions that the release group depends on in the report.

EXAMPLES
  Generate a release report of the highest semver release for each package and release group and display it in the
  terminal only.

    $ flub release report

  Output all release report files to the current directory.

    $ flub release report -o .

  Generate a release report for each package and release group in the repo interactively.

    $ flub release report -i
```

_See code: [src/commands/release/report.ts](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/blob/main/build-tools/packages/build-cli/src/commands/release/report.ts)_

## `flub release report-unreleased`

Creates a release report for an unreleased build (one that is not published to npm), using an existing report in the "full" format as input.

```
USAGE
  $ flub release report-unreleased --version <value> --outDir <value> --fullReportFilePath <value> --branchName <value> [-v |
    --quiet]

FLAGS
  --branchName=<value>          (required) Branch name. For release branches, the manifest file is uplaoded by build
                                number and not by current date.
  --fullReportFilePath=<value>  (required) Path to a report file in the 'full' format.
  --outDir=<value>              (required) Release report output directory
  --version=<value>             (required) Version to generate a report for. Typically, this version is the version of a
                                dev build.

LOGGING FLAGS
  -v, --verbose  Enable verbose logging.
      --quiet    Disable all logging.

DESCRIPTION
  Creates a release report for an unreleased build (one that is not published to npm), using an existing report in the
  "full" format as input.

  This command is primarily used to upload reports for non-PR main branch builds so that downstream pipelines can easily
  consume them.
