# @fluid-tools/build-cli

flub is a build and release tool for the Fluid Framework GitHub repositories. flub is intended to replace the existing
fluid build-tools, primarily by reusing existing build-tools functionality and wrapping it in a more consistent,
maintainable CLI using [oclif](https://oclif.io).

# Usage

<!-- This is hardcoded because `oclif readme` creates different output per
platform, and we generate readmes during build -->
```sh-session
$ npm install -g @fluid-tools/build-cli
$ flub COMMAND
running command...
$ flub (--version|-V)
@fluid-tools/build-cli/0.0.0
$ flub --help [COMMAND]
USAGE
  $ flub COMMAND
...

## Developer notes

This package outputs its build files to `lib/` instead of `dist/` like most of our other packages. The reason is that
oclif uses the lib folder by convention, and there are oclif bugs that can be avoided by putting stuff in lib. See the
PR here for an example: <https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/pull/12155>

---

Due to https://github.com/oclif/core/issues/630, the `build:manifest` node script uses an experimental flag. This can be
removed once we have upgraded to Node 16 in the repo.

### Testing

The `release` command provides a `testMode` flag, which subclasses are expected to check when handling states. If in
test mode, all handled states should immediately return true. This enables tests to verify that new states are handled
in some way. Other commands could adopt this, but only the `release command` uses it today.

The `release` command also provides a `state` flag that can be used to initialize the state machine to a specific state.
This is intended for testing.

### Manual Integration Testing and Debugging

There are some VS Code launch targets like `flub generate typetests` that may work in some cases.

To run a locally built version of flub in contexts where the invocation of flub is done via package.json scripts, use a pnpm override.
For client that is:

```
			"@fluid-tools/build-cli": "file:./build-tools/packages/build-cli",
			"@fluidframework/build-tools": "file:./build-tools/packages/build-tools",
			"@fluid-tools/version-tools": "file:./build-tools/packages/version-tools",
			"@fluidframework/bundle-size-tools": "file:./build-tools/packages/bundle-size-tools"
```

This approach can be used with `flub generate typetests` to ensure that the `--level` configuration from the scripts is included, and can be done from a JavaScript Debug console to debug, though breakpoints will need to be set in the `.js` files in `node_modules` (for example in `node_modules/.pnpm/file+build-tools+packages+build-cli_@types+node@18.19.1/node_modules/@fluid-tools/build-cli/lib/commands/generate/typetests.js`).
