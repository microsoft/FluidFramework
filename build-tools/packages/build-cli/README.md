# @fluid-tools/build-cli

flub is a build and release tool for the Fluid Framework GitHub repositories. flub is intended to replace the existing
fluid build-tools, primarily by reusing existing build-tools functionality and wrapping it in a more consistent,
maintainable CLI using [oclif](https://oclif.io).

## Developer notes

This package outputs its build files to `lib/` instead of `dist/` like most of our other packages. The reason is that
oclif uses the lib folder by convention, and there are oclif bugs that can be avoided by putting stuff in lib. See the
PR here for an example: <https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/pull/12155>

### Testing

The `release` command provides a `testMode` flag, which subclasses are expected to check when handling states. If in
test mode, all handled states should immediately return true. This enables tests to verify that new states are handled
in some way. Other commands could adopt this, but only the `release command` uses it today.

The `release` command also provides a `state` flag that can be used to initialize the state machine to a specific state.
This is intended for testing.
