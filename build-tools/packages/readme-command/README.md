# @fluid-private/readme-command

This package implements a single command: a subclass of the oclif readme command class with some minor tweaks. This
package holds only this command because we don't need to distribute the readme command; we only use it locally to
generate the package readmes within the build-tools release group.

## `fluid-readme generate readme`

Adds commands to README.md in current directory.

```
USAGE
  $ fluid-readme generate readme --output-dir <value> --readme-path <value> [--aliases] [--nested-topics-depth
    <value> --multi] [--plugin-directory <value>] [--repository-prefix <value>] [--version <value>]

FLAGS
  --[no-]aliases                 Include aliases in the command list.
  --multi                        Create a different markdown page for each topic.
  --nested-topics-depth=<value>  Max nested topics depth for multi markdown page generation. Use with --multi enabled.
  --output-dir=<value>           (required) [default: docs] Output directory for multi docs.
  --plugin-directory=<value>     Plugin directory to generate README for. Defaults to the current directory.
  --readme-path=<value>          (required) [default: README.md] Path to the README file.
  --repository-prefix=<value>    A template string used to build links to the source code.
  --version=<value>              Version to use in readme links. Defaults to the version in package.json.

DESCRIPTION
  Adds commands to README.md in current directory.

  The readme must have any of the following tags inside of it for it to be replaced or else it will do nothing:

  # Usage
  <!-- usage -->
  # Commands
  <!-- commands -->
  # Table of contents
  <!-- toc -->

  Customize the code URL prefix by setting oclif.repositoryPrefix in package.json.
```

## Developer notes

This package outputs its build files to `lib/` instead of `dist/` like most of our other packages. The reason is that
oclif uses the lib folder by convention, and there are oclif bugs that can be avoided by putting stuff in lib. See the
PR here for an example: <https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/pull/12155>

---

Due to https://github.com/oclif/core/issues/630, the `build:manifest` node script uses an experimental flag. This can be
removed once we have upgraded to Node 16 in the repo.

### Testing

The `release` command provides a `testMode` flag, which subclasses are expected to check when handling states. If in
test mode, all handled states should immediately return true. This enables tests to verify that new states are handled
in some way. Other commands could adopt this, but only the `release command` uses it today.

The `release` command also provides a `state` flag that can be used to initialize the state machine to a specific state.
This is intended for testing.
