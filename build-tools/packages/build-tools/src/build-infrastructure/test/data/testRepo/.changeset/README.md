# Changesets

This folder contains changesets, which are markdown files that hold two key bits of information:

1. a version type (following semver), and
2. change information to be added to a changelog. You can find the full documentation for it
   [in the changesets section of our wiki](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/wiki/Changesets) or in [the official changesets documentation.](https://github.com/changesets/changesets)

There is also a list of [frequently asked questions](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/wiki/Changesets-FAQ) in
the wiki.
