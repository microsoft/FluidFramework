# @fluid-tools/build-tools

This folder used contains packages used for building and managing the contents of Fluid Framework repositories. 

The LTS branch has been migrated to use build tools from main. The sources have been removed from this branch since they are no longer in use. 

This directory and file are left as a workaround, as the @fluid-tools/build-tools package from main expects the presence of a build-tools/ directory,
even if it is empty.
