	// API-Extractor uses the presence of this file in an npm package to determine whether or not its API members
	// should be considered when making decisions about reports and rollups in consuming packages.
	// This includes determining whether or not release tags on external members should be respected when
	// making trimming decisions.
	// We need to ensure this is enabled so that re-exports of API members across package boundaries are correctly
	// trimmed based on their release tags.
	// For more details on this option, see:
