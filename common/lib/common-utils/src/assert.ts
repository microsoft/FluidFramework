 * A browser friendly assert library.
 * Use this instead of the 'assert' package, which has a big impact on bundle sizes.
 * @param condition - The condition that should be true, if the condition is false an error will be thrown.
 * Only use this API when `false` indicates a logic error in the problem and thus a bug that should be fixed.
 * @param message - The message to include in the error when the condition does not hold.
 * A number should not be specified manually: use a string.
 * Before a release, policy-check should be run, which will convert any asserts still using strings to
 * use numbered error codes instead.
