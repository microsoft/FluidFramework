# Get Started

The quickest way to get started with Fluid is to build a component. Here's what that looks like:

1. [Install and run yo fluid](xref:yo-fluid) to create a scaffold for your component, which you will build upon.
2. While implementing your component, you'll [use Fluid's local dev server to test your
   component.](./build-a-component.md#development-process) The local dev server will use the Fluid team's hosted Fluid
   service, called <xref:r11s>.
3. Once you're ready to share your component, you'll [publish it to
   Verdaccio,](./build-a-component.md#publish-your-package) the Fluid team's local NPM repository.
4. You can [use the Fluid Water Park](xref:water-park) to load any Fluid component from Verdaccio, including your own.
