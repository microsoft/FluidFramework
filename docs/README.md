Welcome to Fluid!

We built Fluid to make it simpler for developers to build real-time collaborative experiences using Web technology.

Fluid's [distributed data structures](./guide/dds.md) make it easy to write apps that are collaborative just like you
would build single-user applications and experiences. Fluid handles keeping your data in sync across multiple clients,
so you can focus on your app's business logic. Fluid's data synchronization is fast, efficient, and requires very little
bandwidth. Fluid is extensible, too. You can write components which can be re-used or you can even create new
distributed data structures.

::: danger TypeScript 3.6+ required

Consumers of the Fluid Framework NPM packages **must use a TypeScript version >= 3.6.**
