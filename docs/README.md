# Fluid Framework

Welcome to Fluid!

We built Fluid to make it simpler for developers to build real-time collaborative experiences using Web technology.

Fluid enables distributed, collaborative applications by providing developers with eventually consistent [distributed
data structures](./guide/dds.md), a flexible component and app model, and a reference server implementation called
[Routerlicious](./architecture/server/README.md).

Teams across Microsoft are using Fluid for low latency collaboration, zero setup data persistence, and on-by-default
cross app compatibility. Among other projects, our partner teams are building components for text editing, gaming,
command line tooling, and IOT.

Fluid's [distributed data structures](./guide/dds.md) make it easy to write apps that are collaborative just like you
would build single-user applications and experiences. Fluid handles keeping your data in sync across multiple clients,
so you can focus on your app's business logic. Fluid's data synchronization is fast, efficient, and requires very little
bandwidth. Fluid is extensible, too. You can write components which can be re-used or you can even create new
distributed data structures.
