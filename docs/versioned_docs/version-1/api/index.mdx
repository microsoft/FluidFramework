To get started with the Fluid Framework, you'll want to take a dependency on our client library, [fluid-framework](./fluid-framework).

You'll then want to pair that with the appropriate service client implementation based on your service.
These include:

-   [@fluidframework/azure-client](./azure-client) (for use with [Azure Fluid Relay](../deployment/azure-frs))
-   [@fluidframework/tinylicious-client](./tinylicious-client) (for testing with [Tinylicious](../testing/tinylicious))

For more information on our service client implementations, see [Fluid Services](../deployment/service-options).
