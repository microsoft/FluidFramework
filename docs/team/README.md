# Fluid Runtime team

The Fluid Runtime team is responsible for maintaining the core Fluid runtime, as well as the framework, distributed
data structures, drivers, sample hosts, and tooling. Stated differently, the runtime team are the core maintainers of
[Microsoft/FluidFramework](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/) on GitHub.

People-wise, the runtime team is Curtis Man and his team, but the team also works with Kurt Berglund's team and Steve
Lucco very closely.


### How we work

The Fluid runtime team is – wait for it – *fluid* in how we work. However, we have established primary engineering
contacts for major areas. Should you need to work with the team in a specific area, please start with the primary
engineering contacts for that area.


### How should I engage with the runtime team?

We are consolidating as much as possible to our GitHub presence. If you think you've found a bug, please file an issue.
If you wish there was better documentation on a specific topic, please file an issue.

### Can I contribute?

Yes! We welcome issues and pull requests. However, before investing in writing code, we suggest
opening an issue on GitHub to discuss the changes with the team. We are working on a more comprehensive contribution
guide in February.
