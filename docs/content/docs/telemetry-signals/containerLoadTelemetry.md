Loading a container is a critical point in the lifecycle of a Fluid application. The Fluid Framework generates telemetry data that you can use to monitor the container load process in your own application.

See [Logging and telemetry]({{< relref "telemetry.md" >}}) for an overview of how to use telemetry data generated by the Fluid Framework.

## Connection State Change

When the container's connect state changes (see enum ConnectionState for possible states), an event is emmitted named `fluid:telemetry:Container:ConnectionStateChange_{state}` with the new connection state filled in, e.g. `fluid:telemetry:Container:ConnectionStateChange_Connecting`.  This event is instrumented [here](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/blob/4d12aa275c07246821d8baf1a31332d31250c93e/packages/loader/container-loader/src/container.ts#L1713) and includes many useful properties, such as `opsBehind`, `connectionInitiationReason`, and `connectionMode` (read/write).
