A distributed data structure that holds a set of registers with update versions. On concurrent updates, a register internally stores all possible versions of a value by using reference sequence number of the incoming update.

Using all the stored versions, we can then distinguish amongst different read policies. Below are the policies we support:

Atomic: Atomicity requires a linearizable register. A linearizable register behaves as if there is only a single copy of the data, and that every operation appears to take effect atomically at one point in time. This definition implies that operations are executed in an well-defined order. On a concurrent update, we perform a compare-and-set operation, where we compare a register sequence number with the incoming reference sequence number. The earliest operation overwriting prior sequence numbers wins since every client reaches to an agreement on the value. So we can safely return the first value.

LWW: The last write to a key always wins.
