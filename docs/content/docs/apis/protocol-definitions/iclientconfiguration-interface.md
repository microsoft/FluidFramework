        noopTimeFrequency &amp; noopCountFrequency control how often a client with &quot;write&quot; connection needs to send noop messages in case no other ops are being sent. Any op (including noops) result in client communicating its reference sequence number to the relay service, which can recalculate MSN based on new info. Clients send noops when either noopTimeFrequency ms elapsed from receiving the last op or when receiving noopCountFrequency ops and only if the client did not have a chance to communicate its reference sequence number via regular ops. 'Infinity' will disable this feature and if no value is provided, the client choses some reasonable value.

## Property Details

### blockSize {#blocksize-propertysignature}

#### Signature {#blocksize-signature}

```typescript
blockSize: number;
```

### maxMessageSize {#maxmessagesize-propertysignature}

#### Signature {#maxmessagesize-signature}

```typescript
maxMessageSize: number;
```

### noopCountFrequency {#noopcountfrequency-propertysignature}

Set min op frequency with which noops would be sent in case of an active connection which is not sending any op. See _IClientConfiguration\#noopTimeFrequency_ for more details. 'Infinity' will disable this feature and if no value is provided, the client choses some reasonable value.

#### Signature {#noopcountfrequency-signature}

```typescript
noopCountFrequency?: number;
```

### noopTimeFrequency {#nooptimefrequency-propertysignature}

noopTimeFrequency &amp; noopCountFrequency control how often a client with "write" connection needs to send noop messages in case no other ops are being sent. Any op (including noops) result in client communicating its reference sequence number to the relay service, which can recalculate MSN based on new info. Clients send noops when either noopTimeFrequency ms elapsed from receiving the last op or when receiving noopCountFrequency ops and only if the client did not have a chance to communicate its reference sequence number via regular ops. 'Infinity' will disable this feature and if no value is provided, the client choses some reasonable value.

#### Signature {#nooptimefrequency-signature}

```typescript
noopTimeFrequency?: number;
```
