The `aqueduct` package is a library for building Fluid objects and Fluid containers within the Fluid Framework. Its goal is to provide a thin base layer over the existing Fluid Framework interfaces that allows developers to get started quickly.

## Remarks {#_fluidframework_aqueduct-remarks}

About the library name: An "aqueduct" is a way to transport water from a source to another location. The library name was chosen because its purpose is to facilitate using lower level constructs and therefore handle 'fluid' items same as an aqueduct.

        BaseContainerRuntimeFactory produces container runtimes with the specified data store and service registries, request handlers, runtimeOptions, and entryPoint initialization function. It can be subclassed to implement a first-time initialization procedure for the containers it creates.

        <p>
          This factory should be exposed as fluidExport off the entry point to your module.

          DataObject is a base data store that is primed with a root directory. It ensures that it is created and ready before you can access it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Having a single root directory allows for easier development. Instead of creating and registering channels with the runtime any new DDS that is set on the root will automatically be registered.
