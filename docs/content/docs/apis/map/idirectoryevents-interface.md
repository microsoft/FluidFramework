### (event: "containedValueChanged", listener: (changed: IValueChanged, local: boolean, target: IEventThisPlaceHolder) =&gt; void): any (ALPHA) {#_call_-callsignature}

Emitted when a key is set or deleted. As opposed to the [SharedDirectory](/docs/apis/map/shareddirectory-class)'s valueChanged event, this is emitted only on the [IDirectory](/docs/apis/map/idirectory-interface) that directly contains the key.

```typescript
(event: "containedValueChanged", listener: (changed: IValueChanged, local: boolean, target: IEventThisPlaceHolder) => void): any;
```

#### Remarks {#_call_-remarks}

Listener parameters:

- `changed` - Information on the key that changed and its value prior to the change.

- `local` - Whether the change originated from this client.

- `target` - The [IDirectory](/docs/apis/map/idirectory-interface) itself.

### (event: "subDirectoryCreated", listener: (path: string, local: boolean, target: IEventThisPlaceHolder) =&gt; void): any (ALPHA) {#_call__1-callsignature}
