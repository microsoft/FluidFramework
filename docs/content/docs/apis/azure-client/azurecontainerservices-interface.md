Holds the functionality specifically tied to the Azure Fluid Relay, and how the data stored in the FluidContainer is persisted in the backend and consumed by users.

## Signature {#azurecontainerservices-signature}

export interface AzureContainerServices
```

## Remarks {#azurecontainerservices-remarks}

Returned by the [AzureClient](/docs/apis/azure-client/azureclient-class) alongside a _@fluidframework/fluid-static\#FluidContainer_.
