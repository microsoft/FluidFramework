Views may be written using a variety of UI frameworks. The view adapters module provides helpful tools for composing these views, intended for use when either:

1. The view being composed is from a different framework than its visual host.

2. It is not known which framework was used in the view being composed.

The adapters translate between different view frameworks to satisfy \#1, and are able to inspect a view to deduce its framework to satisfy \#2.
