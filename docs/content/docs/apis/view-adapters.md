Views may be written using a variety of UI frameworks. The view adapters module provides helpful tools for composing these views, intended for use when either:

1. The view being composed is from a different framework than its visual host.

2. It is not known which framework was used in the view being composed.

The adapters translate between different view frameworks to satisfy \#1, and are able to inspect a view to deduce its framework to satisfy \#2.

          Abstracts mounting of views for usage outside of their bundle. Supports React elements.
        </p>
        <p>
          The MountableView must be applied from within the same bundle that provides the view, and then that MountableView can be used by a separate bundle. Attempting to apply a MountableView to a view that was retrieved from a separate bundle is not supported.
