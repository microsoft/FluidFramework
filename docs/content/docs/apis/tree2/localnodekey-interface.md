A key which uniquely identifies a node in the tree within this session.

## Signature {#localnodekey-signature}

```typescript
export interface LocalNodeKey extends Opaque<Brand<SessionSpaceCompressedId, "Local Node Key">>
```

**Extends:** [Opaque](/docs/apis/tree2#opaque-typealias)&lt;[Brand](/docs/apis/tree2#brand-typealias)&lt;[SessionSpaceCompressedId](/docs/apis/id-compressor#sessionspacecompressedid-typealias), "Local Node Key"&gt;&gt;

## Remarks {#localnodekey-remarks}

[LocalNodeKey](/docs/apis/tree2/localnodekey-interface)s must not be serialized and stored as data without first being converted into a [StableNodeKey](/docs/apis/tree2#stablenodekey-typealias). They are local to the current session and equivalent nodes in another session will not necessarily have the same [LocalNodeKey](/docs/apis/tree2/localnodekey-interface). However, they are otherwise preferential to use over [StableNodeKey](/docs/apis/tree2#stablenodekey-typealias)s as they are much smaller. For example, they are more efficient than [StableNodeKey](/docs/apis/tree2#stablenodekey-typealias)s when used as keys in a map. [LocalNodeKey](/docs/apis/tree2/localnodekey-interface)s may be compared or equated via [compareLocalNodeKeys(a, b)](/docs/apis/tree2#comparelocalnodekeys-function).
