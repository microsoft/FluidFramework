Use this as the type of a protected field to cause a type to use nominal typing instead of structural.

WARNING: This API is provided as a beta preview and may change without notice. Use at your own risk.

## Signature {#makenominal-signature}

```typescript
export interface MakeNominal
```

## Remarks {#makenominal-remarks}

Using nominal typing in this way prevents assignment of objects which are not instances of this class to values of this class's type. Classes which are used with "instanceof", or are supposed to be instantiated in particular ways (not just made with object literals) can use this to prevent undesired assignments.

## Example {#makenominal-example}

```typescript
protected _typeCheck?: MakeNominal;
```
