A root in the forest.

The range is a "container" like a field: any additional content inserted before or after contents of this range will be included in the range. This also means that moving the content from this range elsewhere will leave this range valid, but empty.

In some APIs DetachedFields are used as FieldKeys on a special implicit root node to simplify the APIs and implementation.
