## Property Details

### build (ALPHA) {#build-propertysignature}

New detached nodes to be constructed. The ordering has no significance.

{{% callout warning This API is deprecated and will be removed in a future release. %}}
- Builds should be set at the root. TODO:6308 migrate all reader/writers away from this and remove it.

Build instructions for a root that is undergoing a rename should be listed under the starting name. For example, if one wishes to build a tree which is being renamed from ID A to ID B, then the build should be listed under ID A.

{{% /callout %}}

WARNING: This API is provided as an alpha preview and may change without notice. Use at your own risk.

#### Signature {#build-signature}

```typescript
readonly build?: readonly DetachedNodeBuild<TTree>[];
```

### destroy (ALPHA) {#destroy-propertysignature}

New detached nodes to be destroyed. The ordering has no significance.

{{% callout warning This API is deprecated and will be removed in a future release. %}}
- Destroys should be set at the root. TODO:6308 migrate all reader/writers away from this and remove it.

Destruction instructions for a root that is undergoing a rename should be listed under the final name. For example, if one wishes to destroy a tree which is being renamed from ID A to ID B, then the destruction should be listed under ID B.

{{% /callout %}}

WARNING: This API is provided as an alpha preview and may change without notice. Use at your own risk.

#### Signature {#destroy-signature}

```typescript
readonly destroy?: readonly DetachedNodeDestruction[];
```

### global (ALPHA) {#global-propertysignature}

Changes to apply to detached nodes. The ordering has no significance.

Nested changes for a root that is undergoing a rename should be listed under the starting name. For example, if one wishes to change a tree which is being renamed from ID A to ID B, then the changes should be listed under ID A.

WARNING: This API is provided as an alpha preview and may change without notice. Use at your own risk.

#### Signature {#global-signature}

```typescript
readonly global?: readonly DetachedNodeChanges<TTree>[];
```

### local (ALPHA) {#local-propertysignature}

Represents a list of changes to the nodes in the field. The index of each mark within the range of nodes, before applying any of the changes, is not represented explicitly. It corresponds to the sum of `mark.count` values for all previous marks for which `isAttachMark(mark)` is false.

WARNING: This API is provided as an alpha preview and may change without notice. Use at your own risk.

#### Signature {#local-signature}

```typescript
readonly local?: readonly Mark<TTree>[];
```

### rename (ALPHA) {#rename-propertysignature}

Detached whose associated ID needs to be updated. The ordering has no significance. Note that the renames may need to be performed in a specific order to avoid collisions. This ordering problem is left to the consumer of this format.

WARNING: This API is provided as an alpha preview and may change without notice. Use at your own risk.

#### Signature {#rename-signature}

```typescript
readonly rename?: readonly DetachedNodeRename[];
```
