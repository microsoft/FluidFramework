## Property Details

### gcFeature (ALPHA) {#gcfeature-propertysignature}

The version of the GC code that was run to generate the GC data that is written in the summary. If the persisted value doesn't match the current value in the code, saved GC data will be discarded and regenerated from scratch. Also, used to determine whether GC is enabled for this container or not: - A value of 0 or undefined means GC is disabled. - A value greater than 0 means GC is enabled.

WARNING: This API is provided as an alpha preview and may change without notice. Use at your own risk.

#### Signature {#gcfeature-signature}

```typescript
readonly gcFeature?: GCVersion;
```

### gcFeatureMatrix (ALPHA) {#gcfeaturematrix-propertysignature}

A collection of different numerical "Generations" for different features, used to determine feature availability over time. This info may come from multiple sources (FF code, config service, app via Container Runtime Options), and pertains to aspects of the document that may be fixed for its lifetime.

For each dimension, if the persisted value doesn't match the currently provided value, then this file does not support the corresponding feature as currently implemented.

Guidance is that if no value is provided at runtime, it should result in the current default behavior.

WARNING: This API is provided as an alpha preview and may change without notice. Use at your own risk.

#### Signature {#gcfeaturematrix-signature}

```typescript
readonly gcFeatureMatrix?: GCFeatureMatrix;
```

### sessionExpiryTimeoutMs (ALPHA) {#sessionexpirytimeoutms-propertysignature}

If this is present, the session for this container will expire after this time and the container will close

WARNING: This API is provided as an alpha preview and may change without notice. Use at your own risk.

#### Signature {#sessionexpirytimeoutms-signature}

```typescript
readonly sessionExpiryTimeoutMs?: number;
```

### sweepEnabled (ALPHA) {#sweepenabled-propertysignature}

Tells whether the GC sweep phase is enabled for this container. - True means sweep phase is enabled. - False means sweep phase is disabled. If GC is disabled as per gcFeature, sweep is also disabled.
