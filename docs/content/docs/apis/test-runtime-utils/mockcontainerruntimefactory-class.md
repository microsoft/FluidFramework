Factory to create MockContainerRuntime for testing basic submitting and processing of messages. This also acts as a very basic server that stores the messages from all the MockContainerRuntimes and processes them when asked. If test specific logic is required, extend this class and add the logic there. For an example, take a look at MockContainerRuntimeFactoryForReconnection.
