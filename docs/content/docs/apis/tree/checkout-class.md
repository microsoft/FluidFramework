A mutable Checkout of a SharedTree, allowing viewing and interactive transactional editing. Provides [snapshot-isolation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snapshot_isolation) while editing.

A Checkout always shows a consistent sequence of versions of the SharedTree, but it may skip intermediate versions, and may fall behind. In this case consistent means the sequence of versions could occur with fully synchronous shared tree access, though the timing of sequenced edits arriving to the Checkout may be later than they actually arrive in the SharedTree. Specifically no sequenced edits will arrive during an ongoing edit (to implement snapshot isolation): they will be applied asynchronously some time after the ongoing edit is ended.

Events emitted by `Checkout` are documented in [CheckoutEvent](/docs/apis/tree/checkoutevent-enum). Exceptions thrown during event handling will be emitted as error events, which are automatically surfaced as error events on the `SharedTree` used at construction time.
