## Property Details

### editEvictionFrequency {#editevictionfrequency-propertysignature}

The rate at which edits are evicted from memory. This is a factor of the inMemoryHistorySize. For example, with the default frequency of inMemoryHistorySize \* 2 and a size of 10, the log will evict once it reaches 20 sequenced edits down to 10 edits, also keeping any that are still in the collaboration window.

#### Signature {#editevictionfrequency-signature}

```typescript
editEvictionFrequency?: number;
```

### inMemoryHistorySize {#inmemoryhistorysize-propertysignature}

The target number of sequenced edits that the tree will try to store in memory. Depending on eviction frequency and the collaboration window, there can be more edits in memory at a given time. Edits in the collaboration window are not evicted.

The size is set to infinity by default, meaning that all edits in session are kept within memory.

#### Signature {#inmemoryhistorysize-signature}

```typescript
inMemoryHistorySize?: number;
```
