Tracks information about when and where this segment was moved to.

Note that merge-tree does not currently support moving and only supports obliterate. The fields below include "move" in their names to avoid renaming in the future, when moves \_are\_ supported.

## Property Details

### localMovedSeq (ALPHA) {#localmovedseq-propertysignature}

Local seq at which this segment was moved if the move is yet-to-be acked.

WARNING: This API is provided as an alpha preview and may change without notice. Use at your own risk.

#### Signature {#localmovedseq-signature}

```typescript
localMovedSeq?: number;
```

### movedClientIds (ALPHA) {#movedclientids-propertysignature}

List of client IDs that have moved this segment.

The client that actually moved the segment (i.e. whose move op was sequenced first) is stored as the first client in this list. Other clients in the list have all issued concurrent ops to move the segment.

WARNING: This API is provided as an alpha preview and may change without notice. Use at your own risk.

#### Signature {#movedclientids-signature}

```typescript
movedClientIds: number[];
```

### movedSeq (ALPHA) {#movedseq-propertysignature}

The first seq at which this segment was moved.

WARNING: This API is provided as an alpha preview and may change without notice. Use at your own risk.

#### Signature {#movedseq-signature}

```typescript
movedSeq: number;
```

### movedSeqs (ALPHA) {#movedseqs-propertysignature}

All seqs at which this segment was moved. In the case of overlapping, concurrent moves this array will contain multiple seqs.

The seq at `movedSeqs[i]` corresponds to the client id at `movedClientIds[i]`.

The first element corresponds to the seq of the first move

WARNING: This API is provided as an alpha preview and may change without notice. Use at your own risk.

#### Signature {#movedseqs-signature}

```typescript
movedSeqs: number[];
```

### moveDst (ALPHA) {#movedst-propertysignature}

A reference to the inserted destination segment corresponding to this segment's move.

If undefined, the move was an obliterate.

Currently this field is unused, as we only support obliterate operations

WARNING: This API is provided as an alpha preview and may change without notice. Use at your own risk.

#### Signature {#movedst-signature}

```typescript
moveDst?: ReferencePosition;
```

### wasMovedOnInsert (ALPHA) {#wasmovedoninsert-propertysignature}

If this segment was inserted into a concurrently moved range and the move op was sequenced before the insertion op. In this case, the segment is visible only to the inserting client

`wasMovedOnInsert` only applies for acked obliterates. That is, if a segment inserted by a remote client is moved on insertion by a local and unacked obliterate, we do not consider it as having been moved on insert

If a segment is moved on insertion, its length is only ever visible to the client that inserted the segment. This is relevant in partial length calculations

WARNING: This API is provided as an alpha preview and may change without notice. Use at your own risk.

#### Signature {#wasmovedoninsert-signature}

```typescript
wasMovedOnInsert: boolean;
```
