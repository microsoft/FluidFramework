We've included several example apps in [GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidExamples) to demonstrate
both the power and simplicity of Fluid. Use these to learn and kickstart your own projects.

## Draft.js

The [Draft.js](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidExamples/tree/main/draft-js) example shows how to use
Fluid Framework to take an existing local experience and make it collaborative. This example also demonstrates
how to build an app that supports real-time updates in a text editor.

## Brainstorming

The sticky notes [brainstorming app](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidExamples/tree/main/sticky-storm)
shows how simple experiences become compelling when you make them collaborative. This example uses distributed
maps (Shared Maps) to update the state of sticky notes as well as keep track of who added which ideas and who
voted for those ideas.

## Sudoku

a collaborative game. This example includes key features like presence.
