We've included several example apps in a [GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidExamples) repo to demonstrate
both the power and simplicity of Fluid. Use these to learn and kickstart your own projects.

## Draft.js

The [Fluid Draft.js](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidExamples/tree/main/draft-js) example shows how to use the
Fluid Framework to take an existing open source project and make it collaborative. This example also demonstrates
how to build an app that supports real-time updates in a rich text editor.

## Brainstorming

The sticky notes [brainstorming app](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidExamples/tree/main/brainstorm)
shows how simple experiences become compelling when you make them collaborative. This example uses distributed
maps (Shared Maps) to update the state of sticky notes as well as keep track of who added which ideas and who
voted for those ideas.

## Sudoku

a collaborative game. This example includes key features like presence.
