Security is critical to modern web applications. Fluid Framework, as a part of your web application architecture, is an important piece of infrastructure to secure. Fluid Framework is a layered architecture, and auth-related concepts are implemented based on the Fluid service it's connecting to. This means that the specifics of authentication will differ based on the Fluid service.

To learn how authentication and authorization works in Azure Fluid Relay, see [Authentication and authorization in your app](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-fluid-relay/concepts/authentication-authorization). Other Fluid services may differ. See [Available Fluid services]({{< relref "service-options.md" >}}) for more information.
