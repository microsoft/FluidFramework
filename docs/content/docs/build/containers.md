The container is the primary unit of encapsulation in the Fluid Framework.
It allows a group of clients to access the same set of shared objects and co-author changes on those objects.
It is also a permission boundary ensuring visibility and access only to permitted clients.
A container is represented by the `FluidContainer` type and consists of a collection of shared objects and APIs to manage the lifecyle of those objects.

This article will explain:

- How to create and load containers.
- The APIs to interact with them.
- The container lifecycle.

## Creating & loading

Your code creates containers using APIs provided by a service-specific client library.
Each service-specific client library implements a common API for manipulating containers.
For example, the [Tinylicious library]({{< relref "Tinylicious" >}}) provides [these APIs]({{< relref "docs/apis/tinylicious-client.md" >}}) for the Tinylicious Fluid service.
These common APIs enable your code to specify what shared objects should live in the `FluidContainer`, and retrieve the `FluidContainer` once it is created.

### Container schema

Your code must define a schema that represents the structure of the data within the container. A schema can specify:

- Some initial shared objects that are created as soon as the container is created, and are immediately and always available to all connected clients.
- The types of shared objects that can be added to the container at runtime and persisted in the container for use by all connected clients.

The same schema definition that is used to create the container must be provided when clients subsequently load the container. For more information about initial objects and dynamic object creation see [Data modeling]({{< relref "data-modeling.md" >}}).

This example schema defines two initial objects, `layout` and `text`, and declares the distributed data structures (DDSes) `SharedCell` and `SharedString` as shared object types that can be created at runtime.

```typescript
const schema = {
    initialObjects: {
        layout: SharedMap,
        text: SharedString
    },
    dynamicObjectTypes: [ SharedCell, SharedString ],
};
```

Note that even though `SharedString` was used in the `initialObjects` in the example above, it must also be included in `dynamicObjectTypes` if you
want to create dynamic `SharedString` after the container has been created.

### Creating a container

Containers are created from the service-specific client's `createContainer` function.

```typescript {linenos=inline,hl_lines=[7,8]}
const schema = {
    initialObjects: {
        layout: SharedMap,
    },
};

const { container, services } =
    await client.createContainer(schema);

const containerId = await container.attach();
```

Notes:

- `client` represents an object defined by the service-specific client library. See the documentation for the service you are using for more details about how to use its service-specific client library.
- It is a good practice to destructure the object that is returned by `createContainer` into its two main parts; `container` and `services`. For an example using `services`, see [Working with the audience]({{< relref "audience.md#working-with-the-audience" >}}).

A newly created container is in a *detached* state. A detached container is stored on the local client only and therefore no data is shared with other clients yet.
This is the point where you can create initial data to populate your shared objects if needed.
This is often useful in scenarios where you want to make sure that all connected clients have a coherent initial state.
For example, this could mean setting a minimum table size if collaboration involves tables.

### Attaching a container

In order to attach the container to a service, call its `attach` method.
Once *attached*, the Fluid container becomes a live entity living on Fluid service and can be loaded by other clients.

Invoking the container's `attach` method returns the unique identifier for the container.
To load an existing container, this value is used to identify the correct container to load.

Note that once attached, a container cannot be detached. Attach is a one-way operation. When loading an existing
container, the loaded container is always attached.

```typescript {linenos=inline,hl_lines=[10]}
const schema = {
    initialObjects: {
        layout: SharedMap,
    },
};

const { container, services } =
    await client.createContainer(schema);

const containerId = await container.attach();
```

### Loading a container

To load the container created in the above section your code calls the client's `getContainer` method. The call must pass the `id` of the container to load as well as the exact same schema definition used when creating the container. The same container schema is required on all subsequent loads or the container will not be loaded correctly.

Note that when loading an existing container, the container is already attached.

```typescript {linenos=inline}
const schema = {
    initialObjects: {
        layout: SharedMap,
    },
};
const { container, services } =
    await client.getContainer(/*container id*/, schema);
```

## Container lifecycle & events

### Connection state

The container exposes the connected state of the client and emits connected and disconnected events to notify the caller if the underlying connection is disrupted.
Fluid will by default attempt to reconnect in case of lost/intermittent connectivity.
However, `connect()` and `disconnect()` can be used to manually control the connection policy.

```typescript {linenos=inline}
const connectionState = container.connectionState;

container.on("disconnected", () => {
    // prevent user edits to disable data loss.
});

container.on("connected", () => {
    // enable editing if disabled.
});

// Hypothetical event firing when user becomes idle. It is for demonstration purposes only.
user.on("idle", () => {
    // Disconnect the container when idle to prevent unnecessary network traffic/COGS
    container.disconnect();
});

// Hypothetical event firing when user becomes active. It is for demonstration purposes only.
user.on("active", () => {
    // Connect the container when active to resume op processing
    container.connect();
});
```

Notes:
- Connection is established by default whenever an existing container is loaded or a new container is attached.
- Also by default, the container will try to reconnect automatically if connection is lost.
- You likely want to ensure that all pending changes are saved prior to calling `disconnect`.
See the following section on dirty/saved state for more details on that topic.


### Dirty/saved state

A container is considered **dirty** if it has local changes that have not yet been acknowledged by the service. You should always check the `isDirty` flag before disposing the container or disconneting from the service.
If you close or disconnect the container while `isDirty === true`, you may lose operations that have not yet been acknowledged by the service.

A container is considered dirty in the following cases:

1. The container has been created in the detached state, and either it has not been attached yet or it is in the process of being attached (container is in `attaching` state).
  If container is closed prior to being attached, the host may never know if the file was created or not.
2. The container was attached, but it has local changes that have not yet been saved to the service endpoint.
  This occurs as part of normal op flow where pending operation (changes) are awaiting acknowledgement from the service.
  In some cases this can be due to lack of network connection.
  If the network connection is down, it needs to be restored for the pending changes to be acknowledged.

```typescript {linenos=inline}
if(container.isDirty) {
  container.on("saved", () => {
    // safe to dispose or disconnect the container
  });
}
```

In terms of user experience, keep in mind that the `isDirty` value will change rapidly as pending changes are awaiting acknowledgement.
Therefore, the host may choose to incorporate some delay before reading the value again (debouncing), when basing the user experience off of its state.

The container emits the *saved* event to notify the caller that all the local changes have been acknowledged by the service and the document is marked as clean.

```typescript {linenos=inline}
container.on("saved", () => {
    // all pending edits have been saved at this point.
});
```

The container emits the *dirty* event to notify the caller that there are local changes that have not been acknowledged by the service yet and the document is still in a dirty state.

```typescript {linenos=inline}
container.on("dirty", () => {
    // container has pending changes that need to be ack-ed by the service.
});
```

### Disposing a container

The container object may be disposed to remove any server connections and clean up registered events. Once a container is disposed, your code must call `getContainer` again if it needs to  be reloaded.

```typescript {linenos=inline}
container.dispose();

const disposed = container.disposed;

container.on("disposed", () => {
    // handle event cleanup to prevent memory leaks
});
```

As mentioned above, you probably want to make sure all pending changes are saved prior to calling `dispose`.

### Deleting a container

Deleting a container is a service-specific feature, so you should refer to the documentation associated with the specific Fluid service you are using. See [Available Fluid Services]({{< relref "service-options.md" >}}) for more information about Fluid service options.

## Initial objects

Initial objects are shared objects that your code defines in a container's schema and which exist for the lifetime of the container.
These shared objects are exposed via the `initialObjects` property on the container.

```typescript {linenos=inline}
const schema = {
    initialObjects: {
        layout: SharedMap,
        text: SharedString
    },
}

// ...

const layout = container.initialObjects.layout;
const text = container.initialObjects.text;
```

For more information about initial objects see [Data modeling]({{< relref "data-modeling.md" >}}).

### create

The container also exposes a `create` function that enables creation of shared objects at runtime.

For more information about dynamic object creation see [Data modeling]({{< relref "data-modeling.md" >}}).

## Patterns for managing container lifecycle

### Create/load separation

When creating and loading a container, it can be tempting to have a consistent code path for both creation and loading.

However, we generally recommend that creating and loading containers be separated. This provides a cleaner separation of responsibilities within the code itself. Also, in typical use-cases, a user will create a new container through some UI action that results in a redirect to another page whose sole responsibility is to load a container. All subsequent users will load the container by navigating directly to that page.

The drawback of this approach is that when creating a container, the service connection needs to be established twice -- once for the container creation and once for the load. This can introduce latency in the container creation process. For an example of a simple scenario in which it makes sense to combine the flows, see [Using Fluid with React]({{< relref "react.md" >}}).

### Multi-container example

Multiple Fluid containers can be loaded from an application or on a Web page at the same time. There are two primary scenarios where an application would use multiple containers.

First, if your application loads two different experiences that have different underlying data structures. *Experience 1* may require a `SharedMap` and *Experience 2* may require a `SharedString`. To minimize the memory footprint of your application, your code can create two different container schemas and load only the schema that is needed. In this case your app has the capability of loading two different containers (two different schemas) but only loads one for a given user.

A more complex scenario involves loading two containers at once. Containers serve as a permissions boundary, so if you have cases where multiple users with different permissions are collaborating together, you may use multiple containers to ensure users have access only to what they should.
For example, consider an education application where multiple teachers collaborate with students. The students and teachers may have a shared view while the teachers may also have an additional private view on the side. In this scenario the students would be loading one container and the teachers would be loading two.

## Container services

When you load a container, the Fluid service will also return a service-specific *services* object. This object contains
references to useful services you can use to build richer apps. An example of a container service is the
[Audience]({{< relref "audience.md" >}}), which provides user information for clients that are connected to the container.
