This page is about **EXPERIMENTAL** work.

We think it's close to being ready, so we wanted to show it to you early, but the API surface will likely break!

## Property DDS

[PropertyDDS](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/tree/main/experimental/PropertyDDS) represents the managed
data in a typed, hierarchical data model called a *PropertySet*. This model has many similarities to JSON, but is a
richer model, which adds more fine-grained types, additional collection types, references, and gives the ability to use
schemas to describe the structure of properties.

A PropertySet is a tree structured data model in which every node of the tree is a property. More documentation on this
DDS will be available over time.
