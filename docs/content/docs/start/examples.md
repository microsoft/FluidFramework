We've included several example apps in a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidExamples) to demonstrate
both the power and simplicity of Fluid. Use these to learn and kickstart your own projects.

## Brainstorming

The sticky notes [brainstorming app](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidExamples/tree/main/brainstorm)
shows how simple experiences become compelling when you make them collaborative. This example uses distributed
maps (SharedMaps) to update the state of sticky notes as well as keep track of who added which ideas and who
voted for those ideas.
