## Code loader

If your app is bundled separately from your container code, Fluid can use a code loader to download
and load the container code bundle dynamically.

## Container

The container is your application’s entry point to Fluid Framework. It runs your container Code and is
the object through which you’ll retrieve your data objects.

## Container code

You’ll write container code to define which data objects your scenario uses and how you’ll access them.

## DataObject

Aqueduct's implementation of a Fluid Object. Designed to organize Distributed Data Structures into
semantically meaningful groupings for your scenario, as well as, providing an API surface to your data.

## Distributed data structures (DDSes)

DDSes are the data structures Fluid Framework provides for storing the
collaborative data. As collaborators modify the data, the changes will be reflected to all other collaborators.

## Fluid loader

Responsible for connecting to a Fluid service and loading a Container.

## Fluid Object

Any JavaScript object that implements Fluid feature interfaces.

## Fluid service

A service endpoint that is responsible for receiving, processing, storing, and broadcasting operations.

## Fluid service driver

Client code responsible for connecting to the Fluid service.

## Fluid Object

Any JavaScript object that implements Fluid feature interfaces.

## Url resolver

Fluid's API surface makes use of urls, for example in the `Loader`'s `resolve()` method and
`Container`'s `request()` method.  The url resolver is used to interpret these urls for use with the Fluid service.
