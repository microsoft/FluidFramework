## The open source project

With the help of the open source community, the data management capabilities of
Fluid Framework will continue to evolve. Some areas that we’ll be investing in
include more advanced distributed data structures, contracts and interfaces to
ensure code consistency across clients, and performance improvements.

## Fluid Server

This FluidFramework repo contains a reference implementation of a Fluid server
to enable the syncing of operations between clients. The reference server can be
used for your development of Fluid apps as well as be extended and
operationalized as part of your complete Fluid Framework-powered solution. To
make the FluidFramework more accessabile to every developer, Microsoft is
working on standing up a secure, scalable SaaS offering. More information on the
timing will be shared in the future as we get closer to a preview program.

## Microsoft 365 integration

As we looked to release Fluid Framework and get feedback from developers, we’ve
gotten feedback that open source projects work best when they are highly focused
on particular scenarios – to make them more lightweight and adaptable.  For this
reason, we are separating the user experience elements that are connected to
Microsoft 365. Stay tuned for updates on an additional SDK for building
embeddable components within Microsoft 365.
