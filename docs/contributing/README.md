# How to Contribute

There are many ways to contribute to the Fluid project: logging bugs, submitting pull requests with bug fixes or
new features, reporting issues, and adding to documentation.

Check out the [issues list](https://github.com/Microsoft/FluidFramework/issues) for ways you can contribute. Issues
labeled [help wanted](https://github.com/Microsoft/FluidFramework/labels/help%20wanted) are good issues to submit a PR
for. Issues labeled [good first issue](https://github.com/Microsoft/FluidFramework/labels/good%20first%20issue) are great
candidates to pick up if you are in the code for the first time. If you are contributing significant changes, please
discuss with the assignee of the issue first before starting to work on the issue.

## Pull Requests

Before we can accept a pull request from you, you'll need to sign a Contributor License Agreement (CLA). It is an
automated process and you only need to do it once.

To enable us to quickly review and accept your pull requests, always create one pull request per issue and link
the issue in the pull request. Never merge multiple requests in one unless they have the same root cause. Be sure
to follow our [coding guidelines](./coding-guidelines.md) and keep code changes as small as possible.
Avoid pure formatting changes to code that has not been modified otherwise. Pull requests should contain tests
whenever possible.

## Forking

We only accept pull requests from forks of the master branch. To learn more about forking a repo check out [Fork a
repo](https://help.github.com/en/articles/fork-a-repo).
