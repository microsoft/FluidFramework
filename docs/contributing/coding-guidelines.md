# Coding guidelines

## Git

Most work happens directly on the `master` branch. We prefer a **squash and merge workflow** for PRs.

## Indentation

We use spaces, not tabs. If you use a modern code editor like Visual Studio Code this should be configured
automatically.

## Comments

Use [TSDoc comments](https://api-extractor.com/pages/tsdoc/doc_comment_syntax/) for `functions`, `interfaces`,
`enums` and `classes`. These comments will be built into API reference documentation
