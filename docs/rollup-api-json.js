/**
 * Our public API is exposed by re-exporting things from 'internal' packages in 'external' packages, like
 * fluid-framework. API Extractor does not extract re-exported APIs, so this script manipulates the API Extractor JSON
 * output to merge and re-write the API JSON as a workaround.
 *
 * To update the packages combined and how they are combined, edit the rollup-api-data.js file.
 *
 * This script changes source files in place; you may want to create a copy of the source files prior to running this
 * script on them. If you're using the tasks defined in package.json, then you don't need to do this; those scripts
 * create copies.
