Fluid Framework supports modern browsers, including the following:

* The new [Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/edge)
* Safari (latest version, Mac and Mobile)
* [Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox) (latest version)
* [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/index.html) (latest version)

However, using transpilers and other tools in the JavaScript ecosystem, it is possible to create Fluid Framework-based
apps that support additional browsers.
