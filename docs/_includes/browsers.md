There is a lot of nuance in browser support, but in general, the Fluid Framework supports modern browsers, and we recommend
that you use the most up-to-date browser that's compatible with your operating system. The following browsers are
supported.

-   The new [Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/edge)
-   [Safari](https://www.apple.com/safari) (latest version)
-   [Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox) (latest version)
-   [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/index.html) (latest version)

However, using transpilers and other tools in the JavaScript ecosystem, it is possible to create Fluid Framework-based
apps that support additional browsers.
