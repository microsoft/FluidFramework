The Fluid Framework is a multi-layered system consisting of dozens of individual npm packages.
Most developers will only need two or three of these packages for typical Fluid development:
- The [fluid-framework][] package, which contains the public API for the Fluid Framework
- A service-specific client package, such as the [@fluidframework/azure-client](../api/azure-client/index.md).

## Primary API: fluid-framework

The [fluid-framework][] package consists primarily of two portions: the [FluidContainer][] object and a selection of
distributed data structures (DDSes).

### FluidContainer

The [FluidContainer][] object is one of the object types returned by calls to `createContainer()` and `getContainer()` on the [service clients](../deployment/service-options.mdx) such as [AzureClient](../deployment/azure-fluid-relay.mdx).
It includes functionality to retrieve the Fluid data contained within itself, as well as to inspect the state of the collaboration session connection.

### Distributed Data Structures (DDSes)

You'll use one or more DDSes in your container to model your collaborative data.
The [fluid-framework][] package includes a few such data structures that cover a broad range of scenarios:

- [SharedTree](../data-structures/tree/index.mdx): a collaborative tree data structure for building complex, hierarchical data models.
	:::tip
	This is the DDS we recommend for most new applications.
	:::
- [SharedString](../data-structures/string.md): a data structure for collaborative text data.
	:::tip
	This DDS can be used when live, collaborative text editing is required.
	`SharedTree` supports text content, but does not yet support many rich collaborative text editing features.

	For scenarios where collaborative text editing is required, we recommend using `SharedString` _with_ `SharedTree` via [handles](../data-structures/tree/node-types.mdx#leaf-nodes).
	:::
- [SharedMap](../data-structures/map.mdx): a map-like data structure for storing key/value pair data.
	:::warning
	We do not recommend this DDS for new applications. `SharedTree` is a more powerful and flexible alternative that can easily model key/value pair data.
	:::


## Package scopes

Fluid Framework packages are published under one of the following npm scopes:

-   @fluidframework
-   @fluid-experimental
-   @fluid-internal
-   @fluid-tools

In addition to the scoped packages, two unscoped packages are published: the [fluid-framework][] package, described earlier, and the `tinylicious` package, which contains a minimal Fluid server.
For more information, see [Tinylicious](../testing/tinylicious.mdx).

Unless you are contributing to the Fluid Framework, you should only need the unscoped packages and packages from the **@fluidframework** scope.
You can [read more about the scopes and their intent][scopes] in the Fluid Framework wiki.
