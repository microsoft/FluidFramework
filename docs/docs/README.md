# Fluid Framework

Fluid Framework is a TypeScript library for building collaborative web applications.

If you are new to the Fluid Framework, we recommend reading [What is Fluid?](../what-is-fluid.md) to orient yourself.

Fluid requires Node.js and npm. !!!include(node-versions.md)!!! You'll also need a text/code editor and a modern web browser.

**If you're new to web development,** follow [the steps here to set up your Fluid Framework development
environment](./dev-env.md).
