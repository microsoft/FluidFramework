# Roadmap

The Fluid Framework open source project is the first in a series of technologies from Microsoft that will enable developers to build amazing collaborative solutions.

## The open source project

With the help of the open source community, the data management capabilities of Fluid Framework will continue to evolve. Some areas that we’ll be investing in include more advanced distributed data structures, contracts and interfaces to ensure code consistency across clients, and performance improvements.

## Fluid Server

This FluidFramework repo contains a reference implementation of a Fluid server to enable the syncing of operations between clients. The reference server can be used for your development of Fluid apps as well as be extended and operationalized as part of your complete Fluid Framework-powered solution. To make the FluidFramework more accessabile to every developer, Microsoft is working on standing up a secure, scalable SaaS offering. More information on the timing will be shared in the future as we get closer to a preview program.

## Microsoft 365 integration

As we looked to release Fluid Framework and get feedback from developers, we’ve gotten feedback that open source projects work best when they are highly focused on particular scenarios – to make them more lightweight and adaptable.  For this reason, we are separating the user experience elements that are connected to Microsoft 365. Stay tuned for updates on an additional SDK for building embeddable components within Microsoft 365.
