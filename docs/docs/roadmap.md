# Roadmap

The Fluid Framework open source project is the first in a series of technologies from Microsoft that will enable developers to build amazing collaborative solutions.

## The open source project

With the help of the open source community, the data management capabilities of Fluid framework will continue to evolve. Some areas that we’ll be investing in include more advanced distributed data structures, contracts and interfaces to ensure code consistency across clients, and performance improvements.

## Fluid Server

The Fluidframework repo contains a reference implementation of a Fluid server to enable the syncing of operations between clients. That can be used for your development of Fluid apps as well as be extended and operationalized as part of your complete Fluid framework-powered solution. However, if you don’t want to spend your energy on service operationalization, Microsoft is working on standing up a secure, scalable SaaS offering. More information on the timing will be shared in the future as we get closer to a preview program.

## Microsoft 365 integration

Work is underway to build collaborative experiences in Microsoft 365 clients that leverage the Fluid Framework. An additional SDK will become available in the coming months that will enable developers to build self-contained, portable, collaborative application experiences that customers can enable in multiple Microsoft 365 clients. This SDK will likely be governed by the standard Microsoft SDK license agreement.
