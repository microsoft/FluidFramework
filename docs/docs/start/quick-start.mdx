In this Quick Start you will be getting a dice roller Fluid application up and running first on your computer's
localhost.

<MockDiceRollerSample
	style={{
		display: "flex",
		flexDirection: "row",
		justifyContent: "space-evenly",
		flexWrap: "wrap",
		gap: "10px",
	}}
/>

## Set up your development environment

To get started you need the following installed.

-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
    -   <NodeVersions />
-   Code editor
    -   We recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
-   [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

## Getting started

Open a new command window and navigate to the folder you where you want to install the project, and then clone the
[FluidHelloWorld repo](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidHelloWorld) with the following command. The cloning process
will create a subfolder named FluidHelloWorld with the project files in it.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/FluidHelloWorld.git
```

Navigate to the newly created folder and install required dependencies.

```bash
cd FluidHelloWorld
npm install
```

Start both the client and a local server.

```bash
npm start
```

A new browser tab will open to `http://localhost:8080` and you will see the dice roller appear! To see collaboration in
action copy the full URL in the browser, including the ID, into a new window or even a different browser. This opens a
second client for your dice roller application. With both windows open, click the **Roll** button in either and note
that the state of the dice changes in both clients.

ðŸ¥³**Congratulations**ðŸŽ‰ You have successfully taken the first step towards unlocking the world of Fluid collaboration.
