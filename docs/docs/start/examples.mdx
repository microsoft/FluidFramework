We've included several example apps in a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidExamples/) to demonstrate
both the power and simplicity of Fluid. Use these to learn and kickstart your own projects.

## Simple SharedTree Example

The [simple SharedTree example app](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidExamples/tree/main/item-counter) shows how to create a React web app using the SharedTree data structure. This example is designed to be a good starting point for building more sophisticated apps.

## Brainstorming

The sticky notes [brainstorming app](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidExamples/tree/main/brainstorm)
shows how simple experiences become compelling when you make them collaborative. This example uses multiple SharedTree data structures to create, update, and organize sticky notes.
