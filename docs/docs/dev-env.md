# Set up your development environment

First, you'll need to configure your development environment. You can use Visual Studio Code or your own custom
development environment to build Fluid Framework solutions. You can use Windows, macOS, or Linux.

## Install Node.js

Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

!!!include(node-versions.md)!!!

::: tip

**If you do not have Node.js already installed,** we strongly recommend using nvm to simplify installing and managing
multiple Node.js versions.

- [nvm for Windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows)
- [nvm for macOS/Linux](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)

## Install a code editor

You can use any code editor or IDE that supports TypeScript to build with Fluid, such as:

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Atom](https://atom.io)
- [Webstorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm)

## Install a modern browser
