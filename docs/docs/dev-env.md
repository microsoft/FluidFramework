# Set up your development environment

In order to build solutions with the Fluid Framework, ensure that you have installed
[Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download).

!!!include(node-versions.md)!!!

::: tip

We recommend using nvm (for [Windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows) or
[MacOS/Linux](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)) to install Node.js, in case you find yourself needing to install different
versions of Node.js side-by-side.

:::

## Install a code editor

You can use any code editor or IDE that supports TypeScript to build with Fluid, such as:

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Atom](https://atom.io)
- [Webstorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm)
