# Getting started

Fluid Framework is a TypeScript library for building collaborative web applications.

If you are new to the Fluid Framework, we recommend reading [What is Fluid?](../what-is-fluid.md) to orient yourself.

Fluid requires Node.js and npm. !!!include(node-versions.md)!!! To build a Fluid component, you'll also need a text/code
editor and a modern web browser.

**If you're new to web development,** follow [the steps here to set up your Fluid Framework development
environment](dev-env.md).

::: tip

These tutorials are designed to **introduce you to Fluid Framework concepts from the ground up.** If you prefer to learn
by doing, check out [our tutorials](../tutorials/README.md). You might find the tutorials and the guide complementary to
each other.
