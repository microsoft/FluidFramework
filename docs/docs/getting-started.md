# Getting started

Fluid Framework is a TypeScript library for building collaborative web applications.

If you are new to the Fluid Framework, we recommend reading [What is Fluid?](../what-is-fluid.md) to orient yourself.

Fluid requires Node.js and npm. !!!include(node-versions.md)!!! To build a Fluid component, you'll also need a text/code
editor and a modern web browser.

**If you're new to web development,** follow [the steps here to set up your Fluid Framework development
environment](dev-env.md).


## Learn the Fluid Framework

People come to the Fluid Framework from a variety of backgrounds and with different learning styles. Whether you prefer
a more theoretical or a practical approach, we hope you'll find this section helpful.

* If you prefer to **learn by doing**, start with one of our [step-by-step tutorials](../tutorials/README.md).
* If you prefer to **learn concepts step by step**, start with [our guide to Fluid Framework concepts](hello-world.md).

### TypeScript and JavaScript resources

The Fluid Framework documentation assumes some familiarity with programming in the [TypeScript][] language. TypeScript
is a super-set of the JavaScript programming language, so if you're an experienced JavaScript programmer, TypeScript
should feel very familiar. You don't have to be a TypeScript or JavaScript expert, but it's harder to learn both Fluid
Framework and TypeScript/JavaScript at the same time.

If you're new to JavaScript and TypeScript, we recommend starting with the [TypeScript Handbook][ts-handbook].

You may also consdider going through [this JavaScript overview][mdn-tutorial] to check your knowledge level. It will
take you between 30 minutes and an hour and you will feel more confident in your JavaScript skills.


### Practical tutorials

If you prefer to **learn by doing**, start with one of our [step-by-step tutorials](../tutorials/README.md). These
tutorials will guide you through building several Fluid Framework components, explaining the code along the way. You'll
add new features to the components as you go through the tutorials.

### Concept guide

If you prefer to **learn concepts step by step**, our [our guide to Fluid Framework concepts](hello-world.md) is the best
place to start. Every next chapter in it builds on the knowledge introduced in the previous chapters so you won't miss
anything as you go along.


### Advanced concepts

Once you're comfortable with the main concepts and played with the Fluid Framework a little bit, you might be interested
in more advanced topics. This section will introduce you to powerful Fluid Framework capabilities like custom
Distributed Data Structures, the Quorum data structure, task assignment, and more.


### API reference

This documentation section is useful when you want to learn more details about a particular Fluid Framework API. For
example, the [PrimedComponent API reference]() can provide you with details on what different lifecycle methods are
useful for.
