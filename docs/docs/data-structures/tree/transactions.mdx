TODO:#27374: update this page to describe the new transaction API

If you want the `SharedTree` to treat a set of changes atomically, wrap these changes in a transaction.
Using a transaction guarantees that (if applied) all of the changes will be applied together synchronously and no other changes (either from this client or from a remote client) can be interleaved with those changes. Note that the Fluid Framework guarantees this already for any sequence of changes that are submitted synchronously. However, the changes may not be applied at all if the transaction is given one or more constraints.
If any constraint on a transaction is not met, then the transaction and all its changes will ignored by all clients.
Additionally, all changes in a transaction will be reverted together as a single unit by [undo/redo code](./undo-redo.mdx), because changes within a transaction are exposed through a single `Revertible` object.
It is also more efficient for SharedTree to process a large number of changes in a row as a transaction rather than as changes submitted separately.

To create a transaction use the `Tree.runTransaction()` method. You can cancel a transaction from within the callback function by returning the special "rollback object", available via `Tree.runTransaction.rollback`. Also, if an error occurs within the callback, the transaction will be canceled automatically before propagating the error.

In this example, myNode can be any node in the SharedTree. It will be optionally passed into the callback function.

```typescript
Tree.runTransaction(myNode, (node) => {
    // Make multiple changes to the tree.
    // This can be changes to the referenced node but is not limited to that scope.
    if (
        // Something is wrong here!
    ) return "rollback";
})
```

You can also pass a `TreeView` object to `runTransaction()`.

```typescript
Tree.runTransaction(myTreeView, (treeView) => {
	// Make multiple changes to the tree.
});
```

There are example transactions here: [Shared Tree Demo](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidExamples/tree/main/brainstorm).
