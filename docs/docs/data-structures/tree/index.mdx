The `SharedTree` distributed data structure (DDS), available starting with Fluid Framework 2.0, is used to store most or all of your application's shared data in a hierarchical structure.

A `SharedTree` has the following characteristics:

-   It is accessed through a `TreeView` object that exposes all the functionality for reading and editing data within a `SharedTree`.
-   It has a root and can have several types of internal (i.e., non-leaf) nodes and several types of leaf nodes.
-   Although there are some exceptions, for the most part, each type of node closely mirrors a familiar JavaScript datatype, such as object, map, array, boolean, number, string, and null.
-   Again, with exceptions, your code accesses nodes with the syntax of JavaScript and TypeScript, such as dot notation, property assignment, and array indexes.
-   A `TreeView` will conform to a schema that your code creates so it has application-specific strong typing.
-   The various types of internal nodes can be nested (subject to the constraints of the schema).

To get started working with `SharedTree` in your application, read this [quick start guide](../../start/tree-start.mdx).
