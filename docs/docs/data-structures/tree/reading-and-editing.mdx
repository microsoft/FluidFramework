title: Reading and Editing
sidebar_position: 4
---

The `TreeView` object and its children expose properties and methods that allows applications read and edit the tree. The APIs have been designed to match as much as possible the syntax of TypeScript primitives, objects, maps, and arrays; although some editing APIs are different for the sake of making the merge semantics clearer.

## Leaf Node APIs

Leaf nodes are read and written exactly the way JavaScript primitive types are by using dot notation and the assignment operator (`=`). The following example shows how to write to a leaf node:

```typescript
myNewsPaperTree.articles[1].headline = "Man bites dog";
```

The following examples show how to read from a leaf node. _Note that the datatype of `pointsForDetroitTigers` is `number`, not `sf.number`._ This is a general principle: the value returned from a leaf node, other than a `FluidHandle` node, is the underlying JavaScript primitive type.

```typescript
const pointsForDetroitTigers: number = seasonTree.tigersTeam.game1.points;
```

## Object Node APIs

### Reading Object Properties

Your code reads object nodes and their properties exactly as it would from a JavaScript object. The following are some examples.

```typescript
const pointsForDetroitTigers: number = seasonTree.tigersTeam.game1.points;

const counterHandle: FluidHandle = myTree.myObjectNode.myHandle;

const myItems: Items = stickyNotesTree.items;
```

### Creating Objects

You must create the object using the constructor of the class that you derived from the object returned by `SchemaFactory.object()` method. The following shows how to create a note object from the sticky notes example.

```typescript
const babyShowerNote = new Note({
    id: Guid.create().toString(),
    text: "Baby shower is at 3 PM today.",
    author: "Bob",
    lastChanged: 19697 // Days since January 1, 1970, the Unix epoch.
    votes: ["0"]
});
```

We show how to add this note to an array of notes in the tree in [Array node APIs](#array-node-apis).

### Editing Object Properties

To update the property on an object node, you assign a new node or value to it with the assignment operator (`=`).
See [here](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/blob/main/packages/dds/tree/docs/user-facing/object-merge-semantics.md) for details on the merge semantics of these edits.

Note that if the new value is a node (as opposed to a primitive), then its [status](./nodes.mdx#treestatus) must be `TreeStatus.New`,
In other words, it is not possible to set a node that has already been inserted in the tree in the past, even if that node has since been removed.

```typescript
rectangle.topLeft = new Point({ x: 0, y: 0 });
```

```typescript
babyShowerNote.author = "The Joneses";
```

Optional properties can be cleared by assigning `undefined` to them.

```typescript
proposal.text = undefined;
```

## Map Node APIs

### Map Node Read APIs

The read APIs for map nodes have the same names and syntax as the corresponding APIs for JavaScript Map objects.

```typescript
has(key): boolean
```

Returns `true` if the key is present in the map.

```typescript
get(key): T | undefined
```

Returns the value associated with the specified key if any, and returns `undefined` if no value is associated with that key.

```typescript
keys(): IterableIterator<string>
```

Returns an Iterator that contains the keys in the map node.
We do not make guarantees about the ordering of the keys.

```typescript
values(): IterableIterator<T>
```

Returns an Iterator that contains the values in the map node.
We do not make guarantees about the ordering of the values.

```typescript
entries(): IterableIterator<[string, T]>
```

Returns an Iterator that contains the key/value pairs in the map node.
We do not make guarantees about the ordering of the entries.

```typescript
map(callback: ()=>[]): IterableIterator<[string, T]>
```

Returns an array, _not a map node or array node_, that is the result of applying the callback parameter to each member of the original map node. It is just like [Array.map](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map).
We do not make guarantees about the ordering of the entries.

### Map Node Write APIs

The write methods for map nodes are similar to the corresponding methods for JavaScript `Map` objects.
See [here](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/blob/main/packages/dds/tree/docs/user-facing/map-merge-semantics.md) for details on the merge semantics of these edits.

```typescript
set(key: string, value: T)
```

The `set()` method sets/changes the value of the item with the specified key. If the key is not present, the item is added to the map. Note the following:

-   The `T` can be any type that conforms to the map node's schema. For example, if the schema was defined with `class MyMap extends sf.map([sf.number, sf.string]);`, then `T` could be `number` or `string`.
-   If the `value` argument is a node (as opposed to a primitive), then its [status](./nodes.mdx#treestatus) must be `TreeStatus.New`,
    In other words, it is not possible to set a node that has already been inserted in the tree in the past, even if that node has since been removed.
-   If multiple clients set the same key simultaneously, the key gets the value set by the last edit to apply. For the meaning of "simultaneously", see [Types of distributed data structures](../overview.mdx).

```typescript
delete(key: string): void
```

The `delete()` method removes the item with the specified key. If one client sets a key and another deletes it simultaneously, the key is deleted only if the deletion op is the last one applied. For the meaning of "simultaneously", see [Types of distributed data structures](../overview.mdx).

### Map Node Properties

```typescript
size: number;
```

The total number of entries in the map node.

## Array Node APIs

### Array Node Read APIs

Array nodes have all the same non-mutating read methods as the JavaScript [Array](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array) type. (For information about the differences between mutating and non-mutating methods, see [Copying methods and mutating methods](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array#copying_methods_and_mutating_methods)). Note that methods which return an array, like `Array.map()`, when called on an array node, return a JavaScript array, not an object of the type of the array node. For example, if the type is `Notes` from the sticky notes example, an array is returned, not a `Notes` object.

### Array Node Write APIs

The write APIs for array nodes are quite different from JavaScript arrays. They are more suitable for data items that are being worked on collaboratively by multiple people. There are three categories of write APIs: Insert, Remove, and Move.
See [here](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/blob/main/packages/dds/tree/docs/user-facing/array-merge-semantics.md) for details on the merge semantics of these edits.

#### Insert Methods

Array nodes have three methods that insert items into the array.
Note the following:

-   In all of the following, the `T` can be any type that conforms to the array node's schema. For example, if the schema was defined with `class MyArray extends sf.array([sf.number, sf.string]);`, then `T` could be `number` or `string`.
-   Inserted values that are nodes (as opposed to a primitive), must have a [status](./nodes.mdx#treestatus) equal `TreeStatus.New`.
    In other words, it is not possible to set a node that has already been inserted in the tree in the past, even if that node has since been removed.

```typescript
insertAt(index: number, value: Iterable<T>)
```

Inserts the provided value(s) at the specified `index`. If the `index` is greater than the length of the array, the items are inserted at the end of the array.

```typescript
insertAtStart(value: Iterable<T>)
```

Inserts the provided value(s) at the start of the array. This is sugar for `insertAt(0, …)`.

```typescript
insertAtEnd(value: Iterable<T>)
```

Inserts the provided value(s) at the end of the array. This is syntactic sugar for `insertAt(Infinity, …)`.

#### Remove Methods

Array nodes have two methods that remove items from the node. Note the following about these methods:

-   Removed items are saved internally for a time in case they need to be restored as a result of an undo operation.
-   A removed item may be restored as a result of a simultaneous move operation from another client. For example, if one client removes items 3-5, and another client simultaneously moves items 4 and 5, then, if the move operation is ordered last, only item 3 is removed (items 4 and 5 are restored and moved to their destination by the move operation). If the remove operation is ordered last, then all three items will be removed, no matter where they reside.
-   Removal of items never overrides inserting (or moving in) items. For example, if one client removes items 10-15, and another client simultaneously inserts an item at index 12, the original items 10-15 are removed, but new item is inserted between item 9 and the item that used to be at index 16. This is true regardless of the order of the remove and insert operations.

For the meaning of "simultaneously", see [Types of distributed data structures](../overview.mdx).

```typescript
removeAt(index: number)
```

Removes the item at the given `index`.

```typescript
removeRange(start?: number, end?: number)
```

Removes the items indicated by the `start` index (inclusive) and `end` index (exclusive). If the end index is omitted, every item from the start index to the end of the array is removed. If the start index is omitted, it defaults to 0. So, calling `removeRange()` removes all the items in the array.

#### Move Methods

Array nodes have three methods that move items within an array or from one array node to another. When moving from one array node to another, these methods must be called from the destination array node. Note that in all of the following, the `T` can be any type that is derived from an object that is returned by a call of `SchemaFactory.array()`, such as the `Notes` and `Items` classes in the sticky notes example.

Note the following about these methods:

-   If multiple clients simultaneously move an item, then that item will be moved to the destination indicated by the move of the client whose edit is ordered last.
-   A moved item may be removed as a result of a simultaneous remove operation from another client. For example, if one client moves items 3-5, and another client simultaneously removes items 4 and 5, then, if the remove operation is ordered last, items 4 and 5 are removed from their destination by the remove operation. If the move operation is ordered last, then all three items will be moved to the destination.
-   We also expose variations of these methods for moving a single item.

For the meaning of "simultaneously", see [Types of distributed data structures](../overview.mdx).

```typescript
moveRangeToStart(sourceStartIndex: number, sourceEndIndex: number, source?: T)
```

Moves the specified items to the start of the array. Specify a `source` array if it is different from the destination array.

```typescript
moveRangeToEnd(sourceStartIndex: number, sourceEndIndex: number, source?: T)
```

Moves the specified items to the end of the array. Specify a `source` array if it is different from the destination array.

```typescript
moveRangeToIndex(destinationGap: number, sourceStartIndex: number, sourceEndIndex: number, source?: T)
```

Moves the items to the specified `destinationGap` in the destination array.
Specify a `source` array if it is different from the destination array.
If the items are being moved within the same array, the `destinationGap` position is interpreted including the items being moved (as if a new copy of the moved items were being inserted, without removing the originals).
See [the doc comments](https://fluidframework.com/docs/api/tree/treearraynode-interface#moverangetoindex-methodsignature) for details.
