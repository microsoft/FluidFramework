# Types of Schema Changes

Understanding which types of schema changes are safe versus breaking is crucial for evolving your [SharedTree](../index.mdx) schemas without disrupting existing applications.

## Compatible Changes

The following changes are [backwards compatible](index.mdx#backwards-compatibility).
However, it's important that applications carefully whether the change is [forwards compatible](./index.mdx#forwards-compatibility) inherently or if a [staged rollout](./index.mdx#staged-rollouts) is necessary.

### Adding Optional Fields

Adding optional fields to existing node types is always [backwards compatible](./index.mdx#understanding-compatibility):

```typescript
// Before
class Note extends factory.object("Note", {
    id: factory.string,
    text: factory.string,
}) {}

// After - Safe addition
class Note extends factory.object("Note", {
    id: factory.string,
    text: factory.string,
    color: factory.optional(factory.string), // New optional field
}) {}
```

However, older clients that don't know about this new field will not be able to read it.
To ensure [forwards compatibility](./index.mdx#understanding-compatibility), use [`allowUnknownOptionalFields`](../../../api/fluid-framework/objectnodeschema-interface#allowunknownoptionalfields-property) to handle new optional fields added by newer clients:

```typescript
class Note extends factory.object("Note", {
    id: factory.string,
    text: factory.string,
    // Existing optional fields
}, { allowUnknownOptionalFields: true }) {}
```

### Making Required Fields Optional

Converting a required field to optional is always [backwards compatible](./index.mdx#backwards-compatibility):

```typescript
// Before
class Circle extends factory.object("Circle", {
    center: Point,
    radius: factory.number, // Required
}) {}

// After - Safe change
class Circle extends factory.object("Circle", {
    center: Point,
    radius: factory.optional(factory.number), // Now optional
}) {}
```

### Adding New Allowed Types

Adding new allowed types to existing fields is [backwards compatible](./index.mdx#backwards-compatibility), but not [forwards compatible](./index.mdx#forwards-compatibility):

```typescript
// Before
class Whiteboard extends factory.object("Whiteboard", {
    elements: factory.array([TextElement]),
}) {}

// After - Safe addition
class Whiteboard extends factory.object("Whiteboard", {
    elements: factory.array([TextElement, ImageElement]), // New type added
}) {}
```

To achieve [forwards compatibility](./index.mdx#forwards-compatibility), staged allowed types can be used to [roll out](./index.mdx#staged-rollouts) support for reading before writing, allowing older clients to read data created with new types (TODO add a guide on this process).

## Incompatible Changes

These changes will break compatibility with existing data and require careful migration:

### Removing Fields

Removing fields from node types breaks older clients:

```typescript
// Breaking: Removing field
class Note extends factory.object("Note", {
    id: factory.string,
    // text: factory.string, // REMOVED - breaks older clients
}) {}
```

### Making Optional Fields Required

Making an optional field required breaks documents that don't have that field:

```typescript
// Breaking: Making optional field required
class Note extends factory.object("Note", {
    id: factory.string,
    text: factory.string,
    color: factory.string, // Was optional, now required - BREAKING!
}) {}
```

### Changing Field Types

Changing field types breaks existing data:

```typescript
// Breaking: Changing field type
class Note extends factory.object("Note", {
    id: factory.string,
    position: factory.string, // Was factory.number - BREAKING!
}) {}
```

### Removing Allowed Types

Removing allowed types from fields breaks documents containing those types:

```typescript
// Breaking: Removing allowed type
class Whiteboard extends factory.object("Whiteboard", {
    elements: factory.array([TextElement]), // ImageElement removed - BREAKING!
}) {}
```

## Best Practices

### Avoid Optional Maps and Arrays

In many cases, optional maps and optional arrays are an anti-pattern.
This is because maps and arrays already have an empty state (e.g. a map with no entries, or an empty array []).
For most applications, there is no meaningful difference between an empty map and a lack of a map, or between an empty array and a lack of an array.
Unless you have a good reason (for example, when adding a map or array to an existing type), make maps and arrays required.

When maps and arrays are optional, the application must check if the the map or array is undefined at all read sites.
Even worse, the application must do extra work when writing.
If the map/array is not present, then the application must first create the map/array, and only then may populate it.

```typescript
const map = myNode.myMap;
if (map === undefined) {
  myNode.myMap = new MyMap({});
}

myNode.myMap.set("key", "value");
```

Not only does this incur an extra write, but it is also lossy in the face of concurrent edits.
If two users each create the map concurrently, then only one of their maps will end up in the document.
The other map, and subsequent concurrent edits made to that map, will be lost.

### Avoid Redundant Data

It's undesirable to have the same data stored twice in multiple places in the document.
This is because it requires multiple edits (or larger edits) to update the data rather than a single, scoped edit.
Not only is this inefficient but it increases the chance of merge conflicts and it introduces an additional invariant into the document data: these two pieces of data must "stay in sync".

The following is an example of redundant data in the schema.
Users are looked up in a map via their ID, but each user also contains its ID as a property.
This is redundant.
It's not necessary for the user to have the ID field, because to look up the user in the first place, you must already know that user's ID.

```typescript
class User extends sf.object("User", {
  id: sf.string,
}) {}

/** A map from ID to user */
class Users extends sf.map("Users", sf.string, User) {}
```

Data redundancy also applies to derived data.
For example, suppose the document has a list of users, where each user has a score property.
It might also be tempting to store a global "total score" property at the root of the document which is the sum of the scores of all users.
However, this data is completely derived - it is fully computable from other data that is already in the document.
Therefore (if not prohibitively expensive), it should be computed at runtime by the client - and possibly cached in memory if desired - but not cached in the document.

### Factor Out Map and Array Value Types

It is good practice to create named classes for the types that are stored in maps and arrays.

```typescript
class MyFoo extends sf.object("MyFoo", { foo: sf.string }) {}

class MyObject extends sf.object("MyObject", {
  listA: sf.array(MyFoo), // Named (preferred)
  listB: sf.array(sf.object({ foo: sf.string })) // Inlined/unnamed
}) {}
```

Note that the two objects in the example above are structurally equivalent, but only one of them is given a name.
In actuality, both have names, but the inlined one is given a name automatically generated by the system.
Factoring out your type into a class with an explicit name has a few benefits:

- You have more control over what kind of elements are allowed in your structures.
For example, when moving elements between lists, the lists must contain elements with the same type name.
By controlling the type name, you can control which elements can be moved across which lists, even when they are structurally equivalent.
- It reduces the size of the generated .d.ts file.
Because of the way that SharedTree schema types expand in the compiler, output files can grow to very large sizes if too many types are inlined.
By giving the types names, the compiler can reference them via their name string rather than as the composition of all their inner data types.
