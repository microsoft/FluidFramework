The Fluid Framework can be used with any compatible service implementation. Some services, like Tinylicious, are intended only for testing and development, while other hosted options provide the high scalability needed for production-quality applications.

## Azure Fluid Relay

Microsoft [Azure Fluid Relay](https://aka.ms/azurefluidrelay) is a hosted Fluid service. You can [provision Fluid Relay services](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-fluid-relay/how-tos/provision-fluid-azure-portal) as part of your Microsoft Azure subscription and use the <PackageLink packageName="azure-client">@fluidframework/azure-client</PackageLink> library to create and load Fluid containers.

Learn more in the [Azure Fluid Relay documentation](https://aka.ms/azurefluidrelaydocs).

## SharePoint Embedded

Microsoft [SharePoint Embedded](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/embedded/overview) is a cloud-based file and document management system suitable for use in any application. It is a new API-only solution which enables app developers to harness the power of the Microsoft 365 file and document storage platform for any app, and is suitable for enterprises building line of business applications and ISVs building multi-tenant applications.

:::note

SharePoint Embedded is currently in public preview and Fluid Framework integration is not enabled for all M365 tenants. This functionality will be broadly available in February, 2024.

## Tinylicious

[tinylicious](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tinylicious) is a minimal, self-contained implementation of the Fluid Framework service that is much smaller (tinier!) than Routerlicious, the reference implementation of the service.

Tinylicious is intended for testing and development only.

:::tip

The easiest way to try out Fluid is with Tinylicious or Azure Fluid Relay.

## Self-hosted Routerlicious

Fluid Framework's original service implementation, called [Routerlicious][r11s], is part of the Fluid Framework open source project. Routerlicious is not formally supported as a production-quality service, but you can run it using Docker. See the [Routerlicious readme][r11s] for more information about running it.
