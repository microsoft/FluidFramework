The Dice roller is a simple Fluid component that uses Fluid's distributed data structures to simulate rolling a die.

## Set up your dev environment

If you haven't already, [set up your Fluid Framework development
environment](../guide/README.md#set-up-your-development-environment).


First, clone one of the tutorial repositories below. One repository uses React for rendering, and the other uses
JavaScript directly.

* [Dice roller tutorial - Vanilla JavaScript](https://github.com/microsoft/fluid-tutorial-dice-roller)
* [Dice roller tutorial - React](https://github.com/microsoft/fluid-tutorial-dice-roller-react)

Once you've cloned the repo, you'll need to set up access to the [private Fluid NPM feed](../guide/package-feed.md). On
Windows, you can run the `npm run auth` command to automate this process.

Now that you have access to the private feed, run `npm install` in the root of the repository to install dependencies.

Finally, you can open the folder in Visual Studio Code.

## main.tsx

The `src/fluid-components/index.tsx` file is where the component logic lives.

### Declare imports

First we will declare all our imports. Here is a quick description and use cases for each is discussed further below.

`PrimedComponent` and `PrimedComponentFactory` from [@microsoft/fluid-aqueduct](../api/fluid-aqueduct.md) provide helper
functionality. `IComponentHTMLView` from
[@microsoft/fluid-component-core-interfaces](../api/fluid-component-core-interfaces.md) provides the interface for
enabling rendering. `React` and `ReactDOM` enable React use.

```typescript
import {
  PrimedComponent,
  PrimedComponentFactory,
} from "@microsoft/fluid-aqueduct";
import { IComponentHTMLView } from "@microsoft/fluid-component-core-interfaces";

import * as React from "react";
import * as ReactDOM from "react-dom";
```

### Define our component class

Below we define our component class `ExampleFluidComponent`.

#### PrimedComponent

Extending [PrimedComponent](../api/fluid-aqueduct.primedcomponent.md) sets up our component with required default
behavior as well as additional helpers to make component development easier.

##### Key benefits

1. Setup a `root` [SharedDirectory](../api/fluid-map.shareddirectory.md) (a Distributed Data Structure) that we can use to
   store collaborative content and other distributed data structures.
2. Provide `this.createAndAttachComponent(...)` and `this.getComponent(...)` functions for easier creation and access
   to other components.
3. Provide the following setup overrides
   - `componentInitializingFirstTime()` - only called the first time a component is initialized
   - `existing()` - called every time except the first time a component is initialized
   - `opened()` - called every time a component is initialized. After `create` and `existing`.

#### IComponentHTMLView

Implementing the [IComponentHTMLView](../api/fluid-component-core-interfaces.icomponenthtmlview.md) interface
denotes that our component can render an HTML view. Throughout the Fluid Framework we define interfaces as a way to
state our behavior. Whoever is attempting to use this component can know we support this interface and therefore it will
have a `render(...)` function. View rendering is explained more below.

#### Code

```typescript
export class ExampleFluidComponent extends PrimedComponent
  implements IComponentHTMLView {
  // ...
}
```

We also must implement our interface provider. As described above our component is viewable so it implements
`IComponentHTMLView`. By returning the component when this interface is queried, anyone who has a reference to
our component can discover that we implement `IComponentHTMLView`.

```typescript
public get IComponentHTMLView() { return this; }
```

### `componentInitializingFirstTime()`

`componentInitializingFirstTime()` will be called only the first time a client opens the component. In here we perform
setup operations that we only want to happen once.  Since we are using a `PrimedComponent`, we have a `root`
SharedDirectory we can use to store data. We set our initial `diceValue` on our root directory like so:

```typescript
protected async componentInitializingFirstTime() {
  this.root.set("diceValue", 1);
}
```

### `render(div: HTMLElement)`

`render(div: HTMLElement)` is the implementation of `IComponentHTMLView`. The caller provides an `HTMLElement` that the
Component can use to render into. Every time `render(...)` is called we should produce a new view.

::: note

This is the point where React and VanillaJS differ.

:::

:::: tabs
::: tab React
We create a `rerender` function that will display our content into the provided `HTMLElement`.
To get the dice value we use the `get` method on the root, using the same key (`diceValue`) that
we created in `componentInitializingFirstTime()`. Because we are using React we will call
`ReactDOM.render(...)` with a span displaying our dice value as a Unicode character and a button
that rolls the dice when clicked. Finally we pass the provided `HTMLElement` (`div`) into our
`ReactDOM.render(...)` to tell React what to render in.

Once we've created our function we call it once to render the first time.

```jsx
const rerender = () => {
  // Get our dice value stored in the root.
  const diceValue = this.root.get<number>("diceValue");

  ReactDOM.render(
    <div>
      <span style={{fontSize: 50}}>{this.getDiceChar(diceValue)}</span>
      <button onClick={this.rollDice.bind(this)}>Roll</button>
    </div>,
    div
  );
};

rerender();
```

Finally we add a listener so when the value of the dice changes we will trigger a render.

```typescript
this.root.on("valueChanged", () => {
  rerender();
});
```

:::
::: tab VanillaJS
The VanillaJS implementation is similar in many ways to the React version.

We create our component's DOM structure in `this.createComponentDom(div);` which creates the span that
holds the dice value (`diceSpan.textContent = this.getDiceChar(diceValue);`) and the button that when clicked
rolls the dice (`rollButton.onclick = this.rollDice.bind(this);`).

```typescript
private createComponentDom(host: HTMLElement) {
  const diceValue = this.root.get<number>("diceValue");

  const diceSpan = document.createElement("span");
  diceSpan.id = "diceSpan";
  diceSpan.style.fontSize = "50px";
  diceSpan.textContent = this.getDiceChar(diceValue);
  host.appendChild(diceSpan);

  const rollButton = document.createElement("button");
  rollButton.id = "rollButton";
  rollButton.textContent = "Roll";
  rollButton.onclick = this.rollDice.bind(this);
  host.appendChild(rollButton);
}
```

And we register our function to re-render when the value of the dice changes.

```typescript
this.root.on("valueChanged", () => {
  const diceValue = this.root.get<number>("diceValue");
  const diceSpan = document.getElementById("diceSpan");
  diceSpan.textContent = this.getDiceChar(diceValue);
});
```

:::
::::

To set the value of the dice after rolling, we use the `set` method on the root, using the same
key `diceValue` as before.  The helper functions used look like this:

```typescript
private rollDice() {
  const rollValue = Math.floor(Math.random() * 6) + 1;
  this.root.set("diceValue", rollValue);
}

private getDiceChar(value: number) {
  // Unicode 0x2680-0x2685 are the sides of a dice (⚀⚁⚂⚃⚄⚅)
  return String.fromCodePoint(0x267F + value);
}
```

### Component Instantiation

In order to make our component compatible with the Fluid Framework we must have a way of creating a
new instance. We require having an instantiation factory because it's required to define all supported
distributed data structures up front. Defining all the DDSs up front allows for the Fluid Framework to load
from a snapshot without worrying that something might exist in the snapshot that the framework can't understand.

In the example below we use the [PrimedComponentFactory](../api/fluid-aqueduct.primedcomponentfactory.md) as a helper to
create our instantiation factory. As properties we pass in our supported distributed data structures. In this scenario
we don't use any additional distributed data structures, so we pass an empty array.

```typescript
[],
```

The second property is an entry point into our component.

```typescript
ExampleFluidComponent.load;
```

Finally we export this as `fluidExport`.  This export is special - the `@microsoft/fluid-webpack-component-loader` we
are using to load our component knows to look for this particular export to load from.

```typescript
export const fluidExport = new PrimedComponentFactory(
  ExampleFluidComponent,
  [],
);
```

## Custom container

If you instead chose to customize your container during the `yo fluid` setup, a couple things change.

### Factory export

Instead of exporting the `PrimedComponentFactory` directly as the `fluidExport`, we'll instead export this factory
for use in the container we're customizing (in [index.ts](#index-ts)).

```typescript
export const ExampleFluidComponentInstantiationFactory = new PrimedComponentFactory(
  ExampleFluidComponent,
  []
);
```

### `index.ts`

You'll also have a file `./src/index.ts` for the container.  In this file we define a registry of supported components.
This is represented as a `Map<string, IComponentFactory>`. In our scenario we only have one component and therefore
one factory.

We import our `ExampleFluidComponentInstantiationFactory` from our `./main`:

```typescript
import { ExampleFluidComponentInstantiationFactory } from "./main";
```

We import the `package.json` and use the package name as our component name. It's required when creating a new component
to provide this name.

```typescript
const pkg = require("../package.json");
const componentName = pkg.name as string;
```

Finally we use `ContainerRuntimeFactoryWithDefaultComponent` to create the `fluidExport`. The factory takes a default component
name `componentName` that is used to load the default component. It also takes the registry of components pointing to
the creation factory. In our case just our one component
(`[componentName, Promise.resolve(ExampleFluidComponentInstantiationFactory)]`).

```typescript
export const fluidExport = new ContainerRuntimeFactoryWithDefaultComponent(
  componentName,
  new Map([
    [componentName, Promise.resolve(ExampleFluidComponentInstantiationFactory)],
  ])
);
```
