title: Developing a Microsoft 365 package with Fluid capabilities
uid: sudoku-example

---

In this example we will build a collaborative Sudoku game. We will use Fluid distributed data structures to store and
synchronize the Sudoku data.

# Acknowledgements

This example uses the [sudokus](https://github.com/Moeriki/node-sudokus) NPM package by Dieter Luypaert
(<https://github.com/Moeriki>) and the [@types/sudokus](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@types/sudokus) package by Florian
Keller (<https://github.com/ffflorian>).

# Set up your dev environment

1. Install Node.js 10 and VS Code
1. Use the commands below to clone the lab repository:

    ```shell
    $ git clone https://cfyucwwsvf4tpvmuo4nszgxivuqfjgf35o3tnsrbt6csxnoqrrrq@sharkstooth.visualstudio.com/DefaultCollection/Fluid%20Dev%20Kitchen/_git/sudoku-mfx
    $ cd sudoku-mfx
    $ git checkout lab2
    ```

1. Run `npm install` in the root of the repository to install dependencies.
1. Open the resulting folder in VS Code.

## Folder layout

The project has the following folder layout:

```text
├───config
│       config.json
│       copy-assets.json
│       package-solution.json
│       write-manifests.json
└───src
    │   index.ts
    └───sudoku
        │   SudokuWebPart.tsx
        │   SudokuWebPart.manifest.json
        ├───helpers
        │       coordinate.ts
        │       puzzles.ts
        │       styles.css
        │       sudokuCell.ts
        └───view
                sudokuView.tsx
```

The *config* folder contains the WebPart configuration files. The *src* folder contains the source files for the Sudoku
Fluid component, which we'll cover in more depth later.

# Run the sample locally

In order to run the example, run `npm start` from the project root. Then visit <http://localhost:8080/> in a browser.
Two instances of the Sudoku component will be loaded side-by-side. Try entering numbers in the cells in either component
instance. Changes will be synchronized to the other instance.

Try changing the theme in one of the Sudoku components. Notice that these changes are not synchronized between the two
instances.

# Deep dive

## Data model

For our Sudoku data model, we will use a map-like data structure with string keys. Each key in the map is a coordinate
(row, column) of a cell in the Sudoku puzzle. The top left cell has coordinate `"0,0"`, the cell to its right has
coordinate `"0,1"`, etc.

Each value stored in the map is a `SudokuCell`, a simple class that contains the following properties:

```typescript
value: number // The current value in the cell; 0 denotes an empty cell
isCorrect: boolean = false // True if the value in the cell is correct
readonly fixed: boolean; // True if the value in the cell is supplied as part of the puzzle's "clues"
readonly correctValue: number // Stores the correct value of the cell
readonly coordinate: CoordinateString // The coordinate of the cell, as a comma-separated string, e.g. "2,3"
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Objects that are stored in distributed data structures, as SudokuCell is, must be safely JSON-serializable. This means
> that you cannot use functions or TypeScript class properties with these objects, because those are not
> JSON-serialized.
>
> One pattern to address this is to define static functions that accept the object as a parameter and manipulate it. See
> the SudokuCell class in `/helpers/sudokuCell.ts` for an example of this pattern.

## Rendering

In order to render the Sudoku data, we use a React component called `SudokuView` This component is defined in
`view/sudokuView.tsx` and accepts the map of Sudoku cell data as a prop. It then renders the Sudoku and accompanying UI.

The `SudokuView` React component is also responsible for handling UI interaction from the user; we'll examine that in
more detail later.

## The Fluid component

The React component described above does not itself represent a Fluid component. Rather, the Fluid component is defined
in `src/SudokuWebPart.tsx`.

```typescript
export class SudokuWebPart extends BaseMFxPart<{}> {}
```

This class extends the `BaseMfxPart` abstract base class. Our component is visual, so we need to implement the
[IComponentHTMLVisual][] or [IProvideComponentHTMLVisual][] interfaces. However, the `BaseMfxPart` base class already
implements the IProvideComponentHTMLVisual Fluid component interface, so we do not need to explicitly implement it in
our class.

> [!TIP]
> The `{}` in `BaseMFxPart<{}>` denotes that we are not using the SharePoint property bag in this example. Instead, we
> are storing all data directly in Fluid distributed data structures.

We need to implement the `render()` method, which is straightforward since we're using the `SudokuView` React
component to do the heavy lifting.

```typescript
  public render(): void {
    ReactDOM.render(
      <SudokuView puzzle={this.puzzle} />,
      this.domElement);
  }
```

As you can see, the render method uses React to render the `SudokuView` React component. We pass in the puzzle data
which is a `SharedMap` distributed data structure that we will discuss more below.

### Creating Fluid distributed data structures

How does the `puzzle` property get populated? How are distributed data structures created and used?

To answer that question, look at the `onInitializeFirstTime` method in the `SudokuWebPart` class:

```typescript
private sudokuMapKey = "sudoku-map";
private puzzle: ISharedMap;

public async onInitializeFirstTime() {
  // Create a new map for our Sudoku data
  const map = SharedMap.create(this._fluidShim.runtime, this.sudokuMapKey);

  // Populate it with some puzzle data
  loadPuzzle(0, map);

  // Register the map with the Fluid runtime
  map.register();
}
```

This method is called once when a component is initially created. We create a new [SharedMap][] using `.create`, then
register it with the runtime. Notice that we provide a string key, `this.sudokuMapKey`, when we create the `SharedMap`.
This is how we will retrieve the data structure from the Fluid runtime later.

`onInitializeFirstTime` is only called the _first time_ the component is created. This is exactly what we want in order
to create the distributed data structures. We don't want to create new SharedMaps every time a client loads the
component! However, we do need to load the distributed data structures when the component is loaded.

Distributed data structures are initialized asynchronously, so we need to retrieve them from an asynchronous method. We
do that by overloading the asynchronous `_hydrate` method, then store a local reference to the object so we can easily
use it in synchronous code. Notice that we pass

> [!NOTE]
> Overriding the `_hydrate` method is a temporary solution. The code in this method should be in the `onInit` method.

```typescript
  public async _hydrate(runtime: IComponentRuntime, context: IComponentContext): Promise<void> {
    await super._hydrate(runtime, context);

    // Retrieve the distributed data structure (also called a channel in this context)
    this.puzzle = await this._fluidShim.runtime.getChannel(this.sudokuMapKey) as ISharedMap;

    // Since we're using a Fluid distributed data structure to store our Sudoku data, we need to render whenever a value
    // in our map changes. Recall that distributed data structures can be changed by both local and remote clients, so
    // if we don't call render here, then our UI will not update when remote clients change data.
    this.puzzle.on("valueChanged", (changed, local, op) => {
      this.render();
    });
  }
```

### Handling events from distributed data structures

Distributed data structures can be changed by both local and remote clients. In the `_hydrate` method, we also connect
a method to be called each time the Sudoku data - the [SharedMap][] - is changed. In our case we simply call `render`
again. This ensures that our UI updates whenever a remote client changes the Sudoku data.

```typescript
  this.puzzle.on("valueChanged", (changed, local, op) => {
    this.render();
  });
```

### Updating distributed data structures

In the previous step we showed how to use event listeners with distributed data structures to respond to remote data
changes. But how do we update the data based on user input? To do that, we need to listen to some DOM events as users
enter data in the Sudoku cells. Since the `SudokuView` class handles the rendering, that's where the DOM events will be
handled.

Let's look at the event handler for the change event from each Sudoku cell:

> [!NOTE]
> The `handleChange` function can be found in the `SimpleTable` React component within `view/sudokuView.ts`.
> `SimpleTable` is a helper React component that is not exported; you can consider it part of the `SudokuView` React
> component.

```typescript
const handleChange = (e: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => {
    let valueToSet = Number(e.target.value);
    valueToSet = Number.isNaN(valueToSet) ? 0 : valueToSet;
    const key = e.target.getAttribute("data-fluidmapkey");
    if (key !== null) {
        const toSet = props.puzzle.get<SudokuCell>(key);
        toSet.value = valueToSet;
        toSet.isCorrect = valueToSet === toSet.correctValue;
        props.puzzle.set(key, toSet);
    }
};
```

Lines 2 and 3 ensure we only accept numeric values. In line 4, we retrieve the coordinate of the cell from a DOM
attribute that we added during render. Once we have the coordinate, which is a key in the `SharedMap` storing our Sudoku
data, we retrieve the cell data by calling `.get<SudokuCell>(key)`. We then update the cell's value and set whether it
is correct. Finally, we call `.set(key, toSet)` to update the data in the `SharedMap`.

This pattern of first retrieving an object from a `SharedMap`, updating it, then setting it again, is an idiomatic Fluid
pattern. Without calling `.set()`, other clients will not be notified of the updates to the values within the map. By
setting the value, we ensure that Fluid notifies all other clients of the change.

Once the value is set, the `valueChanged` event will be raised on the SharedMap, and as you'll recall from the previous
section, we listen to that event and render again every time the values change. Both local and remote clients will
render based on this event, because all clients are running the same code.

# Lab: Adding "presence" to the Fluid Sudoku component

The Sudoku component is collaborative; multiple clients can update the cells in real time. However, there's no
indication of where other clients are - which cells they're in. In this lab we'll add basic 'presence' to our Sudoku
component, so we can see where other clients are.

To do this, we'll create a new `SharedMap` to store the presence information. Like the map we're using for Sudoku data,
it will be a map of cell coordinates to client names. As clients select cells, the presence map will be updated with the
current client in the cell.

Note that using a SharedMap for presence means that the history of each user's movement - their presence - will be
persisted in the Fluid op stream. In this particular scenario, maintaining a history of a client's movement isn't
particularly interesting, and Fluid provides an alternative mechanism, _signals_, to address cases where persisting ops
isn't necessary. That said, this serves as a useful example of how to use Fluid to solve complex problems with very
little code.

## Create a SharedMap to contain presence data

First, you need to create a `SharedMap` for your presence data.

1. Open `src/sudoku/SudokuWebPart.tsx`.
1. Inside the `SudokuWebPart` class, declare two new private variables like so:

    ```ts
    private presenceMapKey = "clientPresence";
    private clientPresence: ISharedMap;
    ```

1. Inside the `onInitializeFirstTime` method, add the following code below the existing code to create and register a
   second `SharedMap`:

    ```ts
    // Create and register a SharedMap to store presence data
    const clientPresence = SharedMap.create(this._fluidShim.runtime, this.presenceMapKey);
    clientPresence.register();
    ```

    Notice that the Fluid runtime is exposed via the `_fluidShim` property provided by `BaseMfxPart`.

1. Inside the `_hydrate` method, add the following code below the existing code to retrieve the presence map when the
   component initializes:

    ```ts
    this.clientPresence = await this._fluidShim.runtime.getChannel(this.presenceMapKey) as ISharedMap;
    ```

    You now have a `SharedMap` to store presence data. When the component is first created, `onInitializeFirstTime` will
    be called and the presence map will be created. When the component is loaded, `_hydrate` will be called, which
    retrieves the `SharedMap` instance.

## Rendering presence

Now that you have a presence map, you need to render some indication that a remote user is in a cell.

1. Open `src/sudoku/view/sudokuView.tsx`.
1. Add the following code to the `ISudokuViewProps` interface:

    ```ts
    clientId: string;
    clientPresence?: ISharedMap;
    setPresence?(cellCoord: CoordinateString, reset: boolean): void;
    ```

    This interface defines the props that the React component accepts. `setPresence` is a function that the React
    component will call to update presence. Notice that the `clientPresence` and `setPresence` properties are optional.
    This allows the same React component to be used both with and without presence.

1. Inside the `renderGridRows` method, add the following code **before** this line:
   `const disabled = currentCell.fixed === true;`

    ```ts
    if (props.clientPresence) {
        const cellOwner = props.clientPresence.get(coord);
        if (cellOwner && cellOwner !== props.clientId) {
            inputClasses += " presence";
        }
    }
    ```

    You have now added a CSS class to cells based on the data in the presence map. To make sure the local client doesn't
    see presence styles in their own cell, the second `if` check ensures that the cell is occupied by someone other than
    the local client.

## Setting presence data: DOM events

As users click in and out of cells, you need to update the presence map.

1. Still in `src/sudoku/view/sudokuView.tsx`, add the following event handlers under the `handleChange` method:

    ```ts
    const handleInputFocus = (e: React.FocusEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => {
        if (props.setPresence) {
            const key = e.target.getAttribute("data-fluidmapkey");
            if (key !== null) {
                props.setPresence(key, false);
            }
        }
    };

    const handleInputBlur = (e: React.FocusEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => {
        if (props.setPresence) {
            const key = e.target.getAttribute("data-fluidmapkey");
            if (key !== null) {
                props.setPresence(key, true);
            }
        }
    };
    ```

1. Inside the `renderGridRows` method, add `onFocus` and `onBlur` attributes connecting the DOM events to your handlers:

    ```tsx
    onFocus={handleInputFocus}
    onBlur={handleInputBlur}
    ```

## Setting presence data: Wiring it all together

1. Open `src/sudoku/SudokuWebPart.tsx`.
1. Add the following function at the bottom of the `SudokuWebPart` class:

    ```ts
    /**
     * A function that can be used to update presence data.
     *
     * @param cellCoordinate - The coordinate of the cell to set.
     * @param reset - If true, presence for the cell will be cleared.
     */
    private readonly presenceSetter = (cellCoordinate: string, reset: boolean): void => {
        if (this.clientPresence) {
            if (reset) {
                // Retrieve the current clientId in the cell, if there is one
                const prev = this.clientPresence.get<string>(cellCoordinate);
                const isCurrentClient = this._fluidShim.runtime.clientId === prev;
                if (!isCurrentClient) {
                    return;
                }
                this.clientPresence.delete(cellCoordinate);
            } else {
                this.clientPresence.set(cellCoordinate, this._fluidShim.runtime.clientId);
            }
        }
    }
    ```

    You can pass this function in to the `SudokuView` React component as a prop. The component will call it when users
    enter and leave cells, which will update the presence `SharedMap`.

1. Replace the `render` method with the following code:

    ```ts
    public render(): void {
        ReactDOM.render(
            <SudokuView puzzle={this.puzzle}
                clientPresence={this.clientPresence}
                clientId={this._fluidShim.runtime.clientId}
                setPresence={this.presenceSetter}
            />,
            this.domElement);
    }
    ```

    Notice that all of the props you added earlier to the `ISudokuViewProps` interface are now provided.

## Listening to distributed data structure events

1. Still in `src/sudoku/SudokuWebPart.tsx`, add the following code to call render whenever a remote change is made to
   the presence map:

    ```ts
    this.clientPresence.on("valueChanged", (changed, local, op) => {
        this.render();
    });
    ```

## Testing the changes

TODO

# Implementing a Fluid component interface

TODO: will walk through adding the [IComponentReactViewable][] interface.

# Adding move history to the Fluid Sudoku component

TODO: **(stretch goal)** will walk through adding a SharedObjectSequence to store the history of moves that have been
made.
