## üå≥ SharedTree DDS Changes

### TreeBranchEvents now exposes the rootChanged event ([#24014](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/issues/24014))

`TreeBranchEvents` now includes the `rootChanged` event from `TreeViewEvents`.

Commit: [`702a08a`](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/702a08af83206c21e1016ca47051052fa8554aa5)

### New SchemaFactoryAlpha.scopedFactory method ([#23987](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/issues/23987))

The [`SchemaFactoryAlpha.scopedFactory`](https://fluidframework.com/docs/api/fluid-framework/schemafactoryalpha-class) method has been added, providing an easy way to create a new `SchemaFactory` with a nested scope string.

### Rules regarding how and when lazy schema references are resolved have been clarified ([#24030](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/issues/24030))

A lazy schema reference is a [LazyItem](https://fluidframework.com/docs/api/fluid-framework/lazyitem-typealias) referencing a [TreeNodeSchema](https://fluidframework.com/docs/api/fluid-framework/treenodeschema-typealias). They typically look like `() => MySchema` and are used when a [forward reference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_declaration#Forward_reference) from one schema to another is required (including but not limited to recursive and co-recursive schema).

[TreeViewConfiguration](https://fluidframework.com/docs/api/fluid-framework/treeviewconfiguration-class#_constructor_-constructor) now documents its significance with respect to lazy schema references. Additionally some implicit assumptions like no modifications of [AllowedTypes](https://fluidframework.com/docs/api/fluid-framework/allowedtypes-typealias) after resolving of lazy schema references have been enforced (such modifications would previously cause undefined behavior in the future, and now an error is thrown when trying to modify them).

`evaluateLazySchema` has been added as an `@alpha` API that is now consistently used by all internal code when evaluating lazy schema references. This ensures consistent behavior and error reporting, but also adds caching. Therefore it is now supported for applications to have lazy schema references which compute the schema when invoked, without having to implement their own caching as long as those applications use `evaluateLazySchema` anytime they need to evaluate a lazy schema reference.

Commit: [`23f3279`](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/23f32794dbd3672dcc18e2a9ba2f16f4bf1241f0)

### Alpha APIs for replacing handles in export formats have been redesigned ([#24061](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/issues/24061))

The various import and export [`VerboseTree`](https://fluidframework.com/docs/api/fluid-framework/verbosetree-typealias) and [`ConciseTree`](https://fluidframework.com/docs/api/fluid-framework/concisetree-typealias) APIs no longer include `valueConverter` options. Instead the resulting tree can be further processed to do any desired replacements. The following `@alpha` APIs have been added to assist with this:

1. `cloneWithReplacements`
2. `replaceHandles`
3. `replaceConciseTreeHandles`
4. `replaceVerboseTreeHandles`

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Deprecations

### IContainer.getContainerPackageInfo() is now deprecated ([#23840](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/issues/23840))

The `IContainer.getContainerPackageInfo()` function is now deprecated. This API will be removed in version 2.40.0. Use `IFluidCodeDetails.package` returned by `IContainer.getLoadedCodeDetails()` instead.

See [issue #23898](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/issues/23898) for details.

### The process and processDocumentSchemaOp functions have been removed ([#24018](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/issues/24018))

`process` has been replaced by `processMessages` from the following:

- `FluidDataStoreRuntime`
- `IDeltaHandler`
- `IFluidDataStoreChannel`
- `MockFluidDataStoreRuntime`
- `MockDeltaConnection`

`processDocumentSchemaOp` has been replaced by `processDocumentSchemaMessages` from `DocumentsSchemaController`.

See the [deprecation release note](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/releases/tag/client_v2.5.0#user-content-the-process-function-on-ifluiddatastorechannel-ideltahandler-mockfluiddatastoreruntime-and-mockdeltaconnection-is-now-deprecated-22840) for more details.

### Deprecated ILoaderOptions have been removed ([#24046](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/issues/24046))

Previously `ILoaderOptions` exported from `container-loader` was extending the base `ILoaderOptions` defined in `container-definitions` to add an experimental `summarizeProtocolTree` property which was used to test single-commit summaries. The option is no longer required or in use, so the extended version of `ILoaderOptions` is not needed anymore. Use `@fluidframework/container-definitions#ILoaderOptions` instead.

## Other Changes

### The OrderedEditSet interface now has a getLocalEdits method ([#23244](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/issues/23244))

Previously, `EditLog` was imported to cast to this type for access to the `getLocalEdits` method. In addition, the `./test/EditLog` export has been removed.
