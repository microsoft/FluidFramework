## ‚ú® New Features

### New alpha `onAssertionFailure` API ([#24089](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/issues/24089))

A new `@alpha` API is added called `onAssertionFailure` which can be used to get a callback when an assertion fails indicating a bug in the Fluid Framework. This callback is invoked before the exception is thrown, reducing the chances of the exception being lost or replaced with a different exception before making it to a catch block which reports it. It can also be used to break into the debugger when the assertion occurs to aid in debugging the cause.

```ts
import { onAssertionFailure } from "fluid-framework/alpha";

let firstAssertion: Error | undefined;

onAssertionFailure((error: Error) => {
  const priorErrorNote =
    firstAssertion === undefined
      ? "Please report this bug."
      : `Might be caused due to prior error ${JSON.stringify(firstAssertion.message)} which should be investigated first.`;
  const message = `Encountered Bug in Fluid Framework: ${error.message}\n${priorErrorNote}\n${error.stack}`;
  console.error(message);

  debugger;
  firstAssertion ??= error;
});
```

## üå≥ SharedTree DDS Changes

### Better type errors for invalid recursive schema ([#24080](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/issues/24080))

Constraints have been added to `*Recursive` [`SchemaFactory`](https://fluidframework.com/docs/api/fluid-framework/schemafactory-class) methods to ensure correct use without relying on [`ValidateRecursiveSchema`](https://fluidframework.com/docs/api/fluid-framework/validaterecursiveschema-typealias) as much.

### Improve tree shaking for code which imports `SharedTreeAttributes` ([#24135](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/issues/24135))

Bundling code that imports `SharedTreeAttributes` from `@fluidframework/tree/legacy` should now better prune out the rest of the tree package's code. This change reduced the dependency on webpack's [`usedExports`](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/optimization/#optimizationusedexports) when tree shaking, but other bundlers should also benefit.

### Improvements to typing of object node schema ([#24143](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/issues/24143))

Several tweaks to the typing of object node schema have been made to allow exposing an `@alpha` `ObjectNodeSchema` type.

[SchemaFactoryAlpha](https://fluidframework.com/docs/api/fluid-framework/schemafactoryalpha-class)'s `object` and `objectRecursive` now return schema which are compatible with the new `ObjectNodeSchema` type. This new `ObjectNodeSchema` type exposes a `fields: ReadonlyMap<string, FieldSchemaAlpha & SimpleObjectFieldSchema>` property which provides an easy way to get information about the object's fields.

Additionally an alpha `ObjectNodeSchema` object is added to enable support for `schema instanceof ObjectNodeSchema` to safely narrow `TreeNodeSchema` to this new type.

In support of this work, several typing details were fixed including:

- `info` field of `[typeSchemaSymbol]` type brand on recursive object schema was specified to match non-recursive variants.
- Type of field metadata was correctly plumbed through `optionalReclusive` and `requiredRecursive`.
- When fields object provided to [SchemaFactory.object](https://fluidframework.com/docs/api/fluid-framework/schemafactory-class#object-method) is typed as `RestrictiveStringRecord<ImplicitFieldSchema>` the resulting [TreeObjectNode](https://fluidframework.com/docs/api/fluid-framework/treeobjectnode-typealias) no longer gets a `Record<string, TreeNode | TreeLeafValue>` signature which could incorrectly conflict with custom members added to the object. Instead `{}` is used to provide no information about felids on the type when the schema provides no information about them. Additionally this case is explicitly made non-constructable: the constructor takes in `never` instead of a `Record<string,never>` which could be erroneously satisfied with an empty object due to how TypeScript assignability rules consider records to have all allowed fields, but also allow objects missing those fields to be assigned to them.

Lastly, `metadata` on the various schema types has been made required instead of optional. This does not impact the APIs for constructing schema: when `undefined` is provided the schema now defaults to `{}` instead of `undefined`. This reduces the number of cases code reading metadata from schema has to handle.

### Improved type checking for recursive object schema Fields ([#24113](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/issues/24113))

Most ways to provide incorrectly typed data for fields of [recursive object schema](https://fluidframework.com/docs/api/fluid-framework/schemafactory-class#objectrecursive-method) now produce simpler type errors without relying on [ValidateRecursiveSchema](https://fluidframework.com/docs/api/fluid-framework/validaterecursiveschema-typealias).

As a side effect of this work, some schema which violated the documented allowed patterns specified by [SchemaFactory](https://fluidframework.com/docs/api/fluid-framework/schemafactory-class#schemafactory-remarks) but used to work (as long as they were not package exported) no longer compile.

The specific case known to break is when:

1. An Object node schema is co-recursive with an Array node schema.
2. The Array does not declare a named subclass.
3. The schema reference from the Object to the Array is not using the [lazy syntax](https://fluidframework.com/docs/api/fluid-framework/lazyitem-typealias).

For example:

```typescript
class Foo extends sf.objectRecursive("Foo", {
  fooList: sf.arrayRecursive("FooList", [() => Foo]), // Bad
}) {}
{
  type _check = ValidateRecursiveSchema<typeof Foo>;
}
```

Such a schema is disallowed according to the documentation. See the ["recursive schema must explicitly declare a named class"](<(https://fluidframework.com/docs/api/fluid-framework/schemafactory-class#schemafactory-remarks)>) remarks. This restriction is necessary to avoid [generated `.d.ts` files replacing recursive references with `any`](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/55832). Fixing this code is now also necessary to avoid a compile error.

```typescript
// Fixed
class FooList extends sf.arrayRecursive("FooList", [() => Foo]) {}
{
  type _check = ValidateRecursiveSchema<typeof FooList>;
}
class Foo extends sf.objectRecursive("Foo", {
  fooList: FooList,
}) {}
{
  type _check = ValidateRecursiveSchema<typeof Foo>;
}
```

This change will also result in much nicer IntelliSense and type errors while fixing the typing if the schema is exported.

There are still several cases which compile but violate this policy regarding recursive schema and can cause issues when exporting schema; these should be migrated to the above pattern as well. It is still valid to use non-recursive structurally named array and map schema inline; this change does not impact them.

### `TreeAlpha.exportConcise` now supports `undefined` ([#24187](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/issues/24187))

There is a new overload for `TreeAlpha.exportConcise` which makes exporting optional fields easier. This overload allows `undefined` and returns `undefined` in this case.

### Performance enhancements in SharedTree branch-related ops processing ([#24093](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/issues/24093))

SharedTree leverages the "op bunching" feature where contiguous ops in a grouped batch are bunched and processed together to asymptotically improve the performance of processing ops. This performance enhancement focuses on the scenario where there are one or more commits in the trunk and one or more peer commits are received in a bunch. With 1 trunk commits and 10 peer commits, the performance increases by 57%; with 100 trunk commits and 100 peer commits, the performance increases by 97%.

Some example scenarios where the performance will be improved:

- A client makes some local changes and another client simultaneously makes a large number of changes in a single JavaScript turn. For example, a client is typing into a canvas while another client pastes a large amount of content into a table.

- A client makes a local branch with some changes and rebases it into the trunk. For example, an AI agent makes changes on a local branch which are accepted by a user resulting in the AI's branch being merged into the trunk.

## Other Changes

### Simplify experimental tree data object implementation ([#23943](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/issues/23943))

The experimental tree data object in `tree-react-api` has been simplified in a way that is incompatible with its previous version, which used `SharedDirectory` at the root. The library now leverages a new data object that uses the `SharedTree` directly at the root. In addition to breaking compatibility with existing documents, these changes include some related simplifications to the APIs which are also breaking:

- Removes the `key` property from the data object configuration. This key was used to inform where the SharedTree was parented beneath the root SharedDirectory, so it no longer serves a purpose.
- Inlined the `ITreeDataObject` interface into `IReactTreeDataObject`.
