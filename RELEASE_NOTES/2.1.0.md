# Fluid Framework v2.1.0

## ‚ú® New Features

### Type guards for DDS types

In the 2.0 release of Fluid, the concrete class implementations for DDSes were hidden from Fluid's API surface. This made `instanceof` checks fail to work correctly. There were ways to work around this in application code, but they involved boilerplate which required more understanding of Fluid internals than should be necessary.

There is now a drop-in replacement to `instanceof`: the static `.is()` method to `SharedObjectKind`, which is available on all DDSes. For example:

```typescript
// Works in Fluid Framework 1.0 but not in the initial release of FluidFramework 2.0:
if (myObject instanceof SharedString) {
  // do something
}

// In Fluid Framework 2.0 and beyond, that code can now be written like so:
if (SharedString.is(myObject)) {
  // do something
}
```


## üå≥ SharedTree DDS changes

### SharedTree content that is removed is now deleted

SharedTree now supports garbage collection so that removed content is not retained forever. This is an internal change and users of SharedTree won't need to adapt any existing code.

This change could cause errors with cross-version collaboration where an older client does not send data that a newer version may need. In this case, a "refresher data not found" error will be thrown.

### Using "delete" on tree fields now throws an error instead of not working correctly

TypeScript allows `delete` on object node optional fields if the `exactOptionalPropertyTypes` tsconfig setting is not
enabled. This does not work correctly at runtime and now produces an informative error.

The `joi` dependency was updated from 14.3.1 to 17.3.1 to address a critical vulnerability exploit [CVE-2020-36604](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-c429-5p7v-vgjp). This required updating the use of `joi` schema validation function within property-query to the new major version syntax.

### Detect arrayNode iterator invalidation

When `arrayNode`s are edited concurrently during iteration, an error will be thrown.

## üêõ Bug Fixes

### The Marker.fromJSONObject and TextSegment.fromJSONObject argument types have been corrected

Previously, the arguments of `Marker.fromJSONObject` and `TextSegment.fromJSONObject` were of type `any`. However, at runtime only certain types were expected and using other types would cause errors.

Now, the argument for the Marker implementation is of type `IJSONSegment` and the argument for the TextSegment implementation is of type `string | IJSONSegment`. This reflects actual runtime support.

This change should have no impact on existing code unless the code is using incorrect types. Such code already does not function and should be corrected.

### tinylicious-client: Promote APIs from beta to public

Some tinylicious-client APIs were marked beta in previous releases. These APIs are now correctly marked public and also sealed to indicate they are not to be implemented externally to Fluid Framework and not changed.

Updated APIs:

- [ITinyliciousAudience](https://fluidframework.com/docs/api/v2/tinylicious-client/itinyliciousaudience-typealias) sealed
- [TinyliciousClient](https://fluidframework.com/docs/api/v2/tinylicious-client/tinyliciousclient-class) sealed
- [TinyliciousClientProps](https://fluidframework.com/docs/api/v2/tinylicious-client/tinyliciousclientprops-interface) sealed
- [TinyliciousConnectionConfig](https://fluidframework.com/docs/api/v2/tinylicious-client/tinyliciousconnectionconfig-interface) sealed
- [TinyliciousContainerServices](https://fluidframework.com/docs/api/v2/tinylicious-client/tinyliciouscontainerservices-interface) sealed
- [TinyliciousMember](https://fluidframework.com/docs/api/v2/tinylicious-client/tinyliciousmember-interface) sealed
- [TinyliciousUser](https://fluidframework.com/docs/api/v2/tinylicious-client/tinylicioususer-interface) sealed

### Some SharedDirectory/SharedMap-related APIs have been sealed

Note that this is a _documentation only change._ There is no runtime or type-level impact.

Some top-level APIs within `@fluidframework/map` and `fluid-framework` have been updated to reflect their sealed/readonly nature. That is, they are not to be implemented externally to Fluid Framework and not changed. This was already the case, but the documentation was not clear.

Updated APIs:

- [IDirectory](https://fluidframework.com/docs/api/v2/fluid-framework/idirectory-interface) sealed
- [IDirectoryEvents](https://fluidframework.com/docs/api/v2/fluid-framework/idirectoryevents-interface) sealed
- [IDirectoryValueChanged](https://fluidframework.com/docs/api/v2/fluid-framework/idirectoryvaluechanged-interface) sealed and path property is readonly
- [ISharedDirectory](https://fluidframework.com/docs/api/v2/fluid-framework/ishareddirectory-interface) sealed
- [ISharedDirectoryEvents](https://fluidframework.com/docs/api/v2/fluid-framework/ishareddirectoryevents-interface) sealed
- [IValueChanged](https://fluidframework.com/docs/api/v2/fluid-framework/ivaluechanged-interface) sealed
