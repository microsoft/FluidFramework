## ✨ New Features

### delete keyword support for ObjectNodes ([#25738](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/issues/25738))

Added support for using the `delete` keyword to remove content under optional fields for ObjectNodes.

```ts
// This is now equivalent to node.foo = undefined
delete node.foo;
```

## 🌳 SharedTree DDS Changes

### Add IndependentTree API ([#25785](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/issues/25785))

New `IndependentTreeAlpha` and `IndependentTreeBeta` APIs provide similar utility to the existing alpha [`IndependentView`](https://fluidframework.com/docs/api/tree#independentview-function) API, except providing access to the [`ViewableTree`](https://fluidframework.com/docs/api/fluid-framework/viewabletree-interface).

This allows for multiple views (in sequence, not concurrently) to be created to test things like schema upgrades and incompatible view schema much more easily (see example below). For `IndependentTreeAlpha`, this also provides access to `exportVerbose` and `exportSimpleSchema` from [`ITreeAlpha`](https://fluidframework.com/docs/api/tree/itreealpha-interface).

An example of how to use `createIndependentTreeBeta` to create multiple views to test a schema upgrade:

```typescript
const tree = createIndependentTreeBeta();

const stagedConfig = new TreeViewConfiguration({
  schema: SchemaFactoryAlpha.types([
    SchemaFactory.number,
    SchemaFactoryAlpha.staged(SchemaFactory.string),
  ]),
});
const afterConfig = new TreeViewConfigurationAlpha({
  schema: [SchemaFactory.number, SchemaFactory.string],
});

// Initialize tree
{
  const view = tree.viewWith(stagedConfig);
  view.initialize(1);
  view.dispose();
}

// Do schema upgrade
{
  const view = tree.viewWith(afterConfig);
  view.upgradeSchema();
  view.root = "A";
  view.dispose();
}

// Can still view tree with staged schema
{
  const view = tree.viewWith(stagedConfig);
  assert.equal(view.root, "A");
  view.dispose();
}
```
