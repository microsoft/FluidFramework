## 🌳 SharedTree DDS Changes

### Add `leaves` and statics to `SchemaFactory`. ([#23787](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/issues/23787))

`SchemaFactory` now has a `leaves` member that is an array of all leaf schema.

`SchemaFactory` now has static members to access leaf schema and create field schema.

## Other Changes

### Target ES2021 ([#23307](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/issues/23307))

The TypeScript build for Fluid Framework packages has been updated to target ES2021 instead of ES2020. This may result in newer JavaScript language features being used. This does not change TypeScript types, nor the JavaScript libraries being used. We only support users which support ES2022, so updating to target ES2021 should not break any supported use-case. Any users which do not have at least ES2021 language feature support may need to transpile out some additional cases after this change.

This should result in slightly reduced bundle size and slightly improved performance for users not transpiling these features out. No major impact is expected.

### odsp-driver no longer depends on node-fetch ([#23796](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/issues/23796))

The `@fluidframework/odsp-driver` package had a dependency on [node-fetch](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-fetch) to provide consistent behavior of the [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) across Node.js and browsers. Since v18 of Node.js, the Node-native Fetch API implementation no longer requires extra flags to be enabled, so the Fetch API is effectively now natively available on all browsers and Node.js. This dependency removal should reduce Fluid Framework's contribution to application bundle sizes.

We expect this change to have no impact for Fluid Framework consumers. However, if you are running Fluid in a Node.js environment with the `--no-experimental-fetch` flag, this is no longer supported.
