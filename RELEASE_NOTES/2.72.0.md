## ✨ New Features

### Expose staged, types, stagedRecursive and typesRecursive on SchemaFactoryBeta ([#25779](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/issues/25779))

These APIs were previously only available on `SchemaFactoryAlpha`, but are now available on `SchemaFactoryBeta`.

## 🌳 SharedTree DDS Changes

### `formatVersion` removed from the options passed to `configuredSharedTree` ([#25752](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/issues/25752))

Note: this change may break users of alpha APIs. See below for details.

`SharedTreeOptions` (which is passed to `configuredSharedTree`) no longer includes a `formatVersion: SharedTreeFormatVersion[keyof SharedTreeFormatVersion]` field. The concept of `SharedTreeFormatVersion` has been removed altogether. Instead, users are expected to leverage the already existing `minVersionForCollab` field.

For migration purposes, the mapping from `SharedTreeFormatVersion` to `minVersionForCollab` is as follows:

- `SharedTreeFormatVersion.v1`: no supported equivalent
- `SharedTreeFormatVersion.v2`: no supported equivalent
- `SharedTreeFormatVersion.v3`: `minVersionForCollab: FluidClientVersion.v2_0`
- `SharedTreeFormatVersion.v5`: `minVersionForCollab: FluidClientVersion.v2_43`
- `SharedTreeFormatVersion.vSharedBranches`: `minVersionForCollab: FluidClientVersion.v2_43` + `SharedTreeOptions.enableSharedBranches`

The values for which there is no supported equivalent `minVersionForCollab` were never given official support. [Contact](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/issues) the Fluid Framework team if you need help migrating away from them.

## Legacy API Changes

### Added a new Fluid error type layerIncompatibilityError ([#25784](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/issues/25784))

A new Fluid error type `layerIncompatibilityError` is added to `FluidErrorTypesAlpha` as @legacy @alpha. This will be moved to `FluidErrorTypes` as @legacy @beta in a future legacy breaking release. It will also be added to `ContainerErrorTypes` since it extends `FluidErrorTypes`.
