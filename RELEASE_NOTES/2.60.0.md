## üö® Breaking Changes

### Remove unnecessary and internal APIs in ISequenceIntervalCollection and related interval types ([#25244](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/issues/25244))

The following APIs are now removed:

- `IInterval.clone`
- `IInterval.modify`
- `IInterval.union`
- `ISerializableInterval`
- `SequenceInterval.clone`
- `SequenceInterval.modify`
- `SequenceInterval.union`
- `SequenceInterval.serialize`
- `SequenceInterval.addPositionChangeListeners`
- `SequenceInterval.removePositionChangeListeners`

These APIs were never intended for public use. There is no migration path, and any usage is strongly discouraged, as it may result in severe errors or data corruption. Please remove any dependencies on these APIs as soon as possible.

## üå≥ SharedTree DDS Changes

### Single-node insertion/removal APIs have been removed from TableSchema (alpha) ([#25233](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/issues/25233))

There is a significant performance benefit to inserting / removing rows / columns in batches. To help encourage more performant usage patterns, single-node insertion and removal APIs have been removed. The APIs that operate on batches should be used instead.

Specifically:

- `insertColumn`
  - Use `insertColumns` instead
- `insertRow`
  - Use `insertRows` instead
- `removeColumn`
  - Use `removeColumns` instead
- `removeRow`
  - Use `removeRows` instead

### Range-based row/column removal methods have been added to TableSchema APIs (alpha) ([#25235](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/issues/25235))

Adds range-based overloads to `removeColumns` and `removeRows` for removing contiguous ranges of rows and columns.

The `removeAllColumns` and `removeAllRows` methods have been removed, as they can be trivially implemented in terms of the new methods.

### Replace "TreeEncodingOptions.useStoredKeys" with "keys" and "KeyEncodingOptions" ([#25263](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/issues/25263))

The alpha API `TreeEncodingOptions` has had its `useStoredKeys` `boolean` replaced with `keys` that takes a `KeyEncodingOptions` allowing for three options instead of the previous two. With the new API, it is now possible to control, for APIs which support it (like [`TreeAlpha.exportVerbose`](https://fluidframework.com/docs/api/fluid-framework/treealpha-interface#exportverbose-methodsignature)), if unknown optional fields will be included when exporting data using stored keys.

Additionally, the relevant options interfaces have been marked as `@input`, indicating that more options may be added as optional parameters in the future, and that should be considered non-breaking.

### Hoist runTransaction method from TreeViewAlpha to TreeBranch ([#25280](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/issues/25280))

Transactions are not view-schema-dependent, so it isn't necessary for them to be exclusive to the view type. `runTransaction` is now available on `TreeBranch` (alpha). `TreeViewAlpha` extends `TreeBranch`, so this change strictly makes the API more accessible.

### SchemaFactoryAlpha.recordRecursive now supports metadata ([#25289](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/issues/25289))

`SchemaFactoryAlpha.recordRecursive` now support metadata like `SchemaFactoryAlpha.recordAlpha` and the other `TreeNodeSchema` creation methods on `SchemaFactoryAlpha` (except for `SchemaFactoryAlpha.record` which does not support metadata).

### FormatValidator added to replace JsonValidator ([#25311](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/issues/25311))

The existing `@alpha` type [`JsonValidator`](https://fluidframework.com/docs/api/fluid-framework/jsonvalidator-interface) has a new type-erased alternative, `FormatValidator`, which is planned to be stabilized to `@beta` in the future. It replaces `JsonValidator` in `ICodecOptions`. Existing code using `ICodecOptions` should migrate to use `FormatValidator`, but this is not required for adopting this release as `JsonValidator` is still supported.

### Add SchemaFactoryBeta ([#25313](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/issues/25313))

`SchemaFactoryBeta` is added to provide a place to partially stabilize APIs from [`SchemaFactoryAlpha`](https://fluidframework.com/docs/api/fluid-framework/schemafactoryalpha-class). Initially just one APIs is added as `@beta`: `scopedFactory`. Users of the existing `@alpha` `scopedFactory` API on `SchemaFactoryAlpha` will need to update to use `scopedFactoryAlpha` if they require the returned factory to be a `SchemaFactoryAlpha` instance.
