# Fluid Framework v2.0.0

Fluid Framework 2 is now generally available and ready for production deployments! üéâ

## New Features

### üå≥ SharedTree DDS 

In Fluid Framework 2, we're introducing a new DDS called SharedTree, a powerful and flexible DDS designed to keep
hierarchical data synchronized between clients. We encourage you to move all new development and containers to
SharedTree. We believe SharedTree is the best option for building with Fluid Framework 2. To learn more, visit the [SharedTree docs](https://fluidframework.com/docs/data-structures/tree/)

Note: As a result of the new DDS, we have marked most pre-existing DDSes as Legacy (not deprecated yet), so you will
have to update your import paths. Learn more about [API support levels](https://fluidframework.com/docs/build/releases-and-apitags/#api-support-levels) and our goal for a graceful [DDS deprecation](https://fluidframework.com/docs/data-structures/overview/#dds-deprecation)
in future.


### üìÅ SharePoint Embedded Support 

We are also introducing support for a new relay option in Fluid Framework 2, called SharePoint Embedded. This is a
Microsoft 365 hosted service that keeps your collaborative Fluid data saved in a partition on SharePoint, allowing you
to harness the power of Microsoft 365 file and document storage platform for you apps. You can integrate with SharePoint
Embedded using the @fluidframework/odsp-client package. To learn more, visit the [SharePoint Embedded docs](https://aka.ms/fluid/spe)


### ü©∫ Fluid DevTools 

Fluid Devleoper Tools is a browser extension that improves the developer experience when writing and debugging Fluid apps. It allows you to peek inside your application's Fluid container and diagnose issues. You can learn more about it in the [DevTools docs](https://aka.ms/fluid/devtool/docs)
