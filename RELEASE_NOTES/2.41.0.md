## ✨ New Features

### New experimental objectIdNumber API ([#21115](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/issues/21115))

A new `objectIdNumber` has been added, which is useful when you need an identifier which corresponds to an object identity. For example: when specifying a React "key" that corresponds to a `TreeNode`.

### New TreeAlpha identifier APIs for converting, retrieving, and generating identifiers ([#24218](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/issues/24218))

#### TreeAlpha.identifier

You can retrieve the long identifier with `TreeAlpha.identifier(node)`, where `node` is a `TreeNode`. The long identifier is a stable, compressible UUID generated by the tree. In cases where the node does not yet have an identifier assigned, this will return `undefined`. These cases include:

- The node does not contain an identifier field.
- The node is a non-hydrated node with a user provided identifier. Note that if it is a non-hydrated node without an identifier provided, it will throw an error.

#### TreeAlpha.identifier.shorten

You can shorten a long identifier with `TreeAlpha.identifier.shorten(branch, identifier)`, where `branch` is a `TreeBranch`, and `identifier` is a `string`. If the method returns a valid short identifier, this identifier can be passed into `TreeAlpha.identifier.lengthen` to get the original valid long `identifier` back. In the cases where it's not possible to shorten the `identifier`, it will return `undefined`. These cases include:

- A compressible long identifier, but it is unrecognized by the tree that the node belongs to. This can occur if the identifier is not generated from the tree.
- An identifier which is not compressible by the tree. This can occur if the node's identifier was a user provided string.

#### TreeAlpha.identifier.lengthen

You can lengthen a short identifier with `TreeAlpha.identifier.lengthen(branch, identifier)`, where `branch` is a `TreeBranch`, and `identifier` is a `number`. If the method returns a valid long identifier, this identifier can be passed into `TreeAlpha.identifier.shorten` to get the original `identifier` back. In the cases where it's not possible to lengthen the `identifier`, this method will throw an error. These cases include:

- An unrecognized short identifier. This can occur if the identifier is not generated from the tree.

#### TreeAlpha.identifier.getShort

You can retrieve the short identifier from a node with `TreeAlpha.identifier.getShort(node)` where `node` is a `TreeNode`. If it is not possible to retrieve the short identifier, it will return `undefined`

##### Example for a node with valid identifier

```typescript
// This will retrieve the short identifier from the node.
const shortIdentifier = TreeAlpha.identifier.getShort(nodeWithValidIdentifier);
```

##### Examples for when you get undefined

In cases where the node provided does not contain an identifier that is recognized or compressible by the tree that the node belongs to, this method will return undefined. This will occur in the following cases:

- The node is an non-hydrated node with a user provided identifier. Note that if it is an non-hydrated node without an identifier provided, it will throw an error.
- The node does not contain an identifier field.
- The node contains a compressible long identifier, but it is unrecognized by the tree that the node belongs to. This can occur if the identifier is not generated from the tree.
- The node contains an identifier which is not compressible by its id compressor. This can occur if the node's identifier was a user provided string.

```typescript
// This will return undefined
const shortIdentifier = TreeAlpha.identifier.getShort(node);
```

#### TreeAlpha.identifier.create

You can create a long identifier from a branch with `TreeAlpha.identifier.create(branch)` where `branch` is a `TreeBranch`.

```typescript
const createdIdentifier = TreeAlpha.identifier.create(branch);
```

### "getPresence(container: IFluidContainer): Presence" now supported ([#24399](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/issues/24399))

You can now use the `getPresence` function to directly acquire `Presence`. In previous releases, you were required to use `ExperimentalPresenceManager` in container schema and calling `getPresenceViaDataObject`, but that is no longer required. Both `ExperimentalPresenceManager` and `getPresenceViaDataObject` are now deprecated.

## 🌳 SharedTree DDS Changes

### The comparePersistedSchema function (alpha) has had its canInitialize parameter removed ([#24606](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/issues/24606))

[comparePersistedSchema](https://fluidframework.com/docs/api/tree/#comparepersistedschema-function) has had its `canInitialize` parameter removed. This parameter was only used to add to the output [SchemaCompatibilityStatus](https://fluidframework.com/docs/api/fluid-framework/schemacompatibilitystatus-interface). If a full `SchemaCompatibilityStatus` is still desired, the `canInitialize` value can be added to the result:

```typescript
// old
const result = comparePersistedSchema(a, b, canInitialize);
// new
const result = { ...comparePersistedSchema(a, b), canInitialize };
```

### TreeAlpha.create now accepts unhydrated nodes ([#24629](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/issues/24629))

[TreeAlpha.create](https://fluidframework.com/docs/api/fluid-framework/treealpha-interface#create-methodsignature) now accepts [unhydrated](https://fluidframework.com/docs/api/fluid-framework/unhydrated-typealias) nodes. `TreeAlpha.create`'s documentation has been updated to clarify that this is supported.

Additionally `TreeAlpha.create` no longer throws a "Tree does not conform to schema" error when given a tree omitting an identifier. Instead, the identifier behaves like it would for other ways to build unhydrated nodes: remaining unreadable until hydrated.

### New TableSchema (alpha) APIs ([#24579](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/issues/24579))

A `TableSchema` utility has been added to Shared Tree for managing dynamic, tabular data. This new `TableSchema` namespace contains APIs for creating column, row, and table [node schema](https://fluidframework.com/docs/api/fluid-framework/treenodeschema-typealias).

Note: these APIs require the use of [SchemaFactoryAlpha](https://fluidframework.com/docs/api/fluid-framework/schemafactoryalpha-class).

> \[!WARNING]
>
> These APIs are in preview and are subject to change. Until these APIs have stabilized, it is not recommended to use them in production code. There may be breaking changes to these APIs and their underlying data format. Using these APIs in production code may result in data loss or corruption.

#### Creating a table

You can craft a table schema with `TableSchema.table`. This includes providing a schema for the cells that will appear in the table:

```typescript
class MyTable extends TableSchema.table({
  schemaFactory,
  cell: schemaFactory.string,
}) {}

const table = new MyTable({
  columns: [{ id: "column-0" }],
  rows: [{ id: "row-0", cells: { "column-0": "Hello world!" } }],
});
```

#### Creating a table with custom column and row schema

To associate additional data with your rows or columns, generate custom row and column schema using `TableSchema.column` and `TableSchema.row`. These schema can then be provided to `TableSchema.table`:

```typescript
class MyColumn extends TableSchema.column({
  schemaFactory,
  cell: Cell,
  props: schemaFactory.object("TableColumnProps", {
    label: schemaFactory.string,
  }),
}) {}

class MyRow extends TableSchema.row({
  schemaFactory,
  cell: Cell,
}) {}

class MyTable extends TableSchema.table({
  schemaFactory,
  cell: Cell,
  column: MyColumn,
  row: MyRow,
}) {}

const table = new MyTable({
  columns: [
    new MyColumn({ props: { label: "Entry" } }),
    new MyColumn({ props: { label: "Date" } }),
    new MyColumn({ props: { label: "Amount" } }),
  ],
  rows: [],
});
```

#### Interacting with the table

Table trees created using `TableSchema` offer various APIs to make working with tabular data easy. These include:

- Insertion and removal of columns, rows, and cells.
- Cell access by column/row.

```typescript
// Create an empty table
const table = MyTable.empty();

const column0 = new MyColumn({
  props: { label: "Column 0" },
});

// Append a column to the end of the table.
table.insertColumn({
  column: column0,
});

const rows = [new MyRow({ cells: {} }), new MyRow({ cells: {} })];

// Insert rows at the beginning of the table.
table.insertRows({
  index: 0,
  rows,
});

// Set cell at row 0, column 0.
table.setCell({
  key: {
    column: column0,
    row: rows[0],
  },
  cell: "Hello",
});

// Set cell at row 1, column 0.
table.setCell({
  key: {
    column: column0,
    row: rows[1],
  },
  cell: "World",
});

// Remove the first row.
// Note: this will also remove the row's cell.
table.removeRow(rows[0]);

// Remove the column.
// Note: this will *not* remove the remaining cell under this column.
table.removeColumn(column0);
```

#### Listening for changes

Listening for changes to table trees behaves just like it would for any other nodes in a Shared Tree (see [here](https://fluidframework.com/docs/data-structures/tree/events) for more details).

The most straightforward option is to listen for any changes to the table node and its descendants. For example:

```typescript
class Cell extends schemaFactory.object("TableCell", {
  value: schemaFactory.string,
}) {}

class Table extends TableSchema.table({
  schemaFactory,
  cell: Cell,
}) {}

const table = new Table({
  columns: [{ id: "column-0" }],
  rows: [{ id: "row-0", cells: {} }],
});

// Listen for any changes to the table and its children.
// The "treeChanged" event will fire when the `table` node or any of its descendants change.
Tree.on(table, "treeChanged", () => {
  // Respond to the change.
});
```

If you need more granular eventing to meet your performance needs, that is possible as well. For example, if you wish to know when the table's list of rows changes, you could do the following:

```typescript
class Cell extends schemaFactory.object("TableCell", {
  value: schemaFactory.string,
}) {}

class Table extends TableSchema.table({
  schemaFactory,
  cell: Cell,
}) {}

const table = new Table({
  columns: [{ id: "column-0" }],
  rows: [{ id: "row-0", cells: {} }],
});

// Listen for any changes to the list of rows.
// The "nodeChanged" event will fire only when the `rows` node itself changes (i.e., its own properties change).
// In this case, the event will fire when a row is added or removed, or the order of the list is changed.
// But it won't fire when a row's properties change, or when the row's cells change, etc.
Tree.on(table.rows, "nodeChanged", () => {
  // Respond to the change.
});
```

#### Limitations

##### Orphaned cells

Cells in the table may become "orphaned." That is, it is possible to enter a state where one or more rows contain cells with no corresponding column. To reduce the likelihood of this, you can manually remove corresponding cells when removing columns.

For example:

```typescript
// Remove column1 and all of its cells.
// The "transaction" method will ensure that all changes are applied atomically.
Tree.runTransaction(table, () => {
  // Remove column1
  table.removeColumn(column1);

  // Remove the cell at column1 for each row.
  for (const row of table.rows) {
    table.removeCell({
      column: column1,
      row,
    });
  }
});
```

> \[!WARNING]
>
> Note that even with the above precaution, it is possible to enter such an orphaned cell state via the merging of edits. For example: one client might add a row while another concurrently removes a column, orphaning the cell where the column and row intersected.

### SharedTrees's FluidClientVersion enum (alpha) has been redesigned ([#24638](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/issues/24638))

Users of [FluidClientVersion](https://fluidframework.com/docs/api/fluid-framework/fluidclientversion-enum)'s `v2_1`, `v2_2`, and `v2_3` entries should specify `v2_0` instead. This will result in no functional differences since no code currently opts into any additional functionality based on specifying those versions. The new approach avoids listing versions which there is currently no reason to select, and thus these options have been removed. If future work adds support to opt into features which only work starting with some of those versions, they will be re-added at that time.

### ForestTypeExpensiveDebug now validates content against schema ([#24658](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/issues/24658))

When opting into using [ForestTypeExpensiveDebug](https://fluidframework.com/docs/api/fluid-framework/#foresttypeexpensivedebug-variable) using [configuredSharedTree](https://fluidframework.com/docs/api/fluid-framework/#configuredsharedtree-function), the tree is now checked against the schema on load and after every edit. This should help detect and diagnose document corruption bugs.

```typescript
const DebugSharedTree = configuredSharedTree({
  jsonValidator: typeboxValidator,
  // Now detects corrupted documents which are out of schema.
  forest: ForestTypeExpensiveDebug,
});
```

### TreeNodes now implicitly generate identifiers on access instead of throwing ([#24665](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/issues/24665))

Accessing a defaulted [identifier](https://fluidframework.com/docs/api/fluid-framework/schemafactory-class#identifier-property) on an [Unhydrated](https://fluidframework.com/docs/api/fluid-framework/unhydrated-typealias) `TreeNode` no longer throws a usage error. Instead, a new UUID is allocated for the identifier and returned. These UUIDs will be more compressible than random ones, since they all come from a single sequence (starting with a random UUID). They will not be fully compressed like the identifiers generated after hydration that leverage the document's [IIdCompressor](https://fluidframework.com/docs/api/id-compressor/iidcompressor-interface).

```typescript
const factory = new SchemaFactory("test");
class HasIdentifier extends schema.object("A", { id: factory.identifier }) {}
// This used to throw an error:
const id = new HasIdentifier({}).id;
```
