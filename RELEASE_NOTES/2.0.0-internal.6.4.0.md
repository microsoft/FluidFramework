## Upcoming: The type of the logger property/param in various APIs will be changing

-   @fluidframework/runtime-definitions
    -   `IFluidDataStoreRuntime.logger` will be re-typed as `ITelemetryBaseLogger`
-   @fluidframework/odsp-driver
    -   `protected OdspDocumentServiceFactoryCore.createDocumentServiceCore`'s parameter `odspLogger` will be re-typed as `ITelemetryLoggerExt`
    -   `protected LocalOdspDocumentServiceFactory.createDocumentServiceCore`'s parameter `odspLogger` will be re-typed as `ITelemetryLoggerExt`

Additionally, several of @fluidframework/telemetry-utils's exports are being marked as internal and should not be consumed outside of other FF packages.

## Some stack traces are improved

Some stack traces have been improved and might now include frames for async functions that weren't previously included.

## tree2: Replace ValueSchema.Serializable with FluidHandle

Replace ValueSchema.Serializable with FluidHandle, removing support for arbitrary objects as tree values and preventing "any" type from Serializable from infecting TreeValue.

## tree2: Restrict struct field names to avoid collisions with schema2 names

Struct field names are now restricted to avoid collisions with schema2 names.
