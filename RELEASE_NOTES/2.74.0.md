## 🌳 SharedTree DDS Changes

### Fixed bug in sending of revert edits after an aborted transaction ([#25978](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/issues/25978))

Aborting a transaction used to put the tree in a state that would trigger an assert when sending some undo/redo edits to peers. This would prevent some undo/redo edits from being sent and would put the tree in a broken state that prevented any further edits. This issue could not have caused document corruption, so reopening the document was a possible remedy. Aborting a transaction no longer puts the tree in such a state, so it is safe to perform undo/redo edits after that.

## ⚠️ Deprecations

### ai-collab library has been removed ([#26008](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/issues/26008))

The team is no longer pursuing this direction for `SharedTree`-based collaboration with AI agents. This library is now considered deprecated. No future versions of this library will be published.

## Legacy API Changes

### Some keys in IFluidCodeDetailsConfig are now reserved for Fluid Framework use ([#25641](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/issues/25641))

The keys of [`IFluidCodeDetailsConfig`](https://fluidframework.com/docs/api/container-definitions/ifluidcodedetailsconfig-interface) (the [type of the `config` property on `IFluidCodeDetails`](https://fluidframework.com/docs/api/container-definitions/ifluidcodedetails-interface#config-propertysignature)) used to be entirely free for consumer use. Going forward, keys with the `"FluidFramework."` prefix are reserved for Fluid Framework's internal use.

We do not expect this to affect any consumers.
