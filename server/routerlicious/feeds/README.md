The files in this folder are lists of packages that should be published to the four npm feeds that we publish to. They
provide an "audit" of what should go where.

As we add/remove/move packages, these lists will change and we use them to verify _before we run the publishing
pipeline_ what will be published. The CI pipeline just publishes the packages in each list to the feed in question. This
makes it far less likely that we find out a package is missing in a feed only after we do a release.

They are generated by running the `generate:packageList` script from the root of the release group. They are also
generated during a build, so these files are kept up-to-date as changes are made.
