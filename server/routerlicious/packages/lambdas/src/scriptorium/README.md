As defined by [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scriptorium), "scriptorium literally "a place for writing", is
commonly used to refer to a room in medieval European monasteries devoted to the writing, copying and illuminating of
manuscripts by monastic scribes."

In our case scriptorium retrieves sequenced messages from Kafka and then writes the message to a database for storage.
