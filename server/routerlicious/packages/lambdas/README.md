# @fluidframework/server-lambdas

Fluid server package that contains core set of Fluid lambdas. Each lambda receives a message from an input stream and
outputs it to another stream. The input and output streams are always abstracted. Lambdas are always triggered by an
incoming message. In addition to processing, lambdas are also responsible for checkpointing their state when messages
are processed and forwarded, hence ensuring at least one processing guarantee.

Checkout each lambda folder for a brief documentation.

See [GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework) for more details on the Fluid Framework and packages within.
