# @fluidframework/server-local-server

Fluid server package containing a basic implementation of an in-memory Fluid server. This has simple implementations for
op storage and ordering, code loading for simple containers, and stubs for document storage and other functionality.

This is ideal for end-to-end testing for more complex scenarios of op combinations.
