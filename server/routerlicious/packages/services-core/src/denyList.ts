 * Interface for a deny list. The goal is to deny requests for given tenantId, documentId
 * that have potential to cause service disruption.
 * That could happen, for example, due to very large summary sizes. While we should always
 * identify and fix causes that lead a document to get into such state, this is a protection
 * mechanism to avoid a DoS situation happening because of a few documents. E.g.: when documents
 * have accumulated very large summary sizes, they can cause Historian and/or GitRest to crash
 * due to OOM, especially given retries from the client and service (Scribe).
