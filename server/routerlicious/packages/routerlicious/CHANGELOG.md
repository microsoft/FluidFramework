# @fluidframework/server-routerlicious

## 6.0.0

### Major Changes

-   Socket Latency Telemetry strategy changed to per-socket-connection ([#23856](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/pull/23856)) [6ab8453fe6](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/6ab8453fe6208e9b1215b6688b39cbb94c1a453a)

    Socket latency tracking strategy was changed to a per-socket strategy for better telemetry granularity. With this, a new config was added (`nexus.socketIo.pingPongLatencyTrackingAggregationThreshold`) and an old config was removed (`nexus.socketIo.pingPongLatencyTrackingIntervalMs`).

-   Types altered to account for undefined and null values ([#23054](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/pull/23054)) [09b7299e1c](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/09b7299e1cbf1d800d4bea2bef6b7d0bc657ddb6)

    Many types updated to reflect implementations that can return null or undefined, but did not call that out in type definitions. Internal functionality only changed to handle existing null/undefined cases that are now known at compiletime.

## 5.0.0

Dependency updates only.

## 4.0.0

### Major Changes

-   Alfred no longer handles websocket traffic ([#19227](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/issues/19227)) [8766d1d800](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/8766d1d800b8e04c4000b36d794a729736f462ba)

    Removed the websocket component of Alfred and stood it as a new microservice, Nexus. When running locally it will run on port 3002. Clients that have discovery enabled and use deltaStreamUrl need no change as they will automatically connect to Nexus. If support for older clients is necessary, an Nginx redirect for Alfred socket requests to be forwarded to Nexus can be used.
