This folder contains configuration information for routerlicious. Some secret values are empty and will need to be filled in, e.g. the translation key in config.json. These can also be set as environment variables and loaded that way. The format of environment variable name depends on how the variable is loaded by nconf, e.g. `worker.intelligence.translation.key` in config.json is loaded as `intelligence__translation__key` from an environment variable since it is loaded from the worker config. Note that two underscores (`__`) are used to delimit the sections of the config variable when loaded as an environment variable.

If you have access to the prague keyvault you can either manually copy the keys you need into environment variables or config.json, or you can run the script located in [FluidFramework/tools/getkeys](../../../../tools/getkeys) to load and set them all to environment variables. In order to have access to the prague keyvault you must be a member of the prague-secrets security group.
