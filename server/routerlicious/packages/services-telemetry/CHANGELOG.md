# @fluidframework/server-services-telemetry

## 6.0.0

### Major Changes

-   Default value for enableGlobalTelemetryContext config changed to true ([#22109](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/pull/22109)) [18b76b29ff](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/18b76b29ff92f2362fb3aaba09c82f13e8b2d7b3)

    Global TelemetryContext is replacing deprecated correlationId tracking. TelemetryContext is now defaulted to enabled, which will automatically output correlationId, tenantId, and documentId in service telemetry.

-   Adds a new property to track the source of the correlationId ([#22280](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/pull/22280)) [7fd8c786b3](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/7fd8c786b339f2dabd93905c41dae8f8dda7bc4b)

    A new property - correlationIdSource - is added to track the source of the correlationId. This source can be either the client or server based on where the correlationId was generated. The `x-telemetry-context` header is generated by the server while the `x-correlation-id` header can be generated by the client. Hence, all requests that have the `x-telemetry-context` header will have the source set to `server`.
