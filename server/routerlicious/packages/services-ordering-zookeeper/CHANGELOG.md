## 6.0.0

### Major Changes

-   Types altered to account for undefined and null values ([#23054](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/pull/23054)) [09b7299e1c](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/09b7299e1cbf1d800d4bea2bef6b7d0bc657ddb6)

    Many types updated to reflect implementations that can return null or undefined, but did not call that out in type definitions. Internal functionality only changed to handle existing null/undefined cases that are now known at compiletime.
