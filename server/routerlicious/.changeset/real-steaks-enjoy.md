protocol-base: Fix: configure user data scrubbing in checkpoints and summaries

_Note: This change is primarily internal to routerlicious._

-   When scribe boots from a checkpoint, it fails over to the latest summary checkpoint if the quorum is corrupted (i.e.
    user data is scrubbed).
-   When scribe writes a checkpoint to DB or a summary, it respects new `IScribeServerConfiguration` options
    (scrubUserDataInSummaries, scrubUserDataInLocalCheckpoints, and scrubUserDataInGlobalCheckpoints) when determining
    whether to scrub user data in the quorum.
-   Added optional param, `scrubUserData`, to `ProtocolOpHandler.getProtocolState()`. When `true`, user data in the quorum
    is replaced with `{ id: "" }`. Defaults to `false`. Previously was always scrubbed.
-   Added the following configuration options for `IScribeServerConfiguration`:

    -   scrubUserDataInSummaries
    -   scrubUserDataInLocalCheckpoints
    -   scrubUserDataInGlobalCheckpoints

    All default to `false`.
