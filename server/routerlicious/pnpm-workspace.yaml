# This is the workspace definition for the server (routerlicious) release group. See https://pnpm.io/pnpm-workspace_yaml
# for more information about the format.
#
# Guidelines for updating this file:
#
# 1. Keep the entries alphabetical wherever possible.
# 2. DO NOT end a glob with "**". E.g. "packages/**". Doing so can include unexpected packages. This is especially true
#    of packages for which we build ESM and CJS. Such packages sometimes have package.json files in their source or
#    output directories during compilation.

packages:
  - "packages/*"

# These entries must be duplicated from package.json due to a pnpm bug where onlyBuiltDependencies
# in package.json is not respected when the workspace has its own lockfile.
# See: https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/9082
onlyBuiltDependencies:
  - classic-level
  - core-js
  - node-rdkafka
  - snappy
  - unrs-resolver
  - zookeeper
