// This file is only used from within the context of a docker build.

// The root fluid build config is renamed to fluidBuild.base.config.cjs within the docker container
// and this file is also placed at the FF repository root, hence the relative path setup below.
// This extra config is necessary in the first place as we don't want to copy the entire FF repo into the docker container,
// thus flub needs to have a pared down set of repoPackages.
