# To allow for ssh access to the repo (to clone locally) we share the volume within a k8s pod with a ssh service.
# Mounted volumes with non-root users get tricky in this case. For now simply running as root for simplicity but
# ideally the node user could gain write permissions to this volume.
# Switch to the node user for security
# USER node

# Node wasn't designed to be run as PID 1. Tini is a tiny init wrapper. You can also set --init on docker later than
# 1.13 but Kubernetes is at 1.12 so we prefer tini for now.

# And set the default command to start the server
