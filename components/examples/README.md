# Example Components & Containers

We put together a group of Fluid components that explore a key group of concepts.

### Components
* [Badge](./badge) - A badge component demonstrating SharedDirectory, SharedMap, SharedCell, and SharedObjectSequence DDSs
* [Clicker](./clicker) - A clicker component that uses an agent and the task manager to monitor the clicker component
* [Collaborative Text Area](./collaborative-textarea) - A very minimal example of using a SharedString within a text area for collaboration

### Containers
* [Dice Roller](./dice-roller) - A basic example that persists a value to the root SharedDirectory
* [Pond](./pond) - A collection of fluid scenarios used primarily for testing
* [Primitives](./primitives) - A container giving a UI to various DDS
* [Simple Component Embed](./simple-component-embed) - A simple example of embedding one component within another
