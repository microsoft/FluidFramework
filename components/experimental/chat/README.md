# Welcome to Chat

This is a sample chat component powered by Fluid.
The aim here is to provide examples of how to obtain user information from the quorum, rendering them in a React component with the Fluent Stardust UI Framework, and utilizing theme providers.
Please note that this is not an example for a production-ready chat client due to concerns such as all users having edit access to the message history. Instead, it is primarily here as a learning tool for integrating the Fluid root and quorum concepts, React, and Stardust UI.

## main.tsx
Here, you will find examples of the following:
- Obtaining current user information: line 52
- Apply Stardust theme provider: line 54
- Fetch history of messages from root: line 47
- Create React component within Fluid: line 55
- Listen for new messages and update state: line 83
- Send message to other users: line 132-140
