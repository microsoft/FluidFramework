/**
 * This example schema shows two ways to share a simple state (in this case
 * the values of two dice as last rolled by clients). No practical application
 * would need both of these states.
 *
 * The first state, lastRoll, is using {@link @fluidframework/presence#LatestRaw| LatestRaw} where
 * all dice values are updated as a whole ({@link DiceValues} structure which has optional values).
 * If any part of the data is updated, then the entire data structure is shared. This means
 * keeping a local copy of the data structure or recomposing it each time making an update.
 *
 * The second state, lastDiceRolls, is using {@link @fluidframework/presence#LatestMapRaw| LatestMapRaw} where
 * each die is updated independently. This allows for more granular updates, but also requires
 * more verbose setting/reading logic and use of boxed values (e.g. `{ value: DieValue}`). This
 * pattern more directly lends itself to handling arbitrary numbers of dice.
 *
 * Throughout the code, the `lastRoll` state is focus of use.
