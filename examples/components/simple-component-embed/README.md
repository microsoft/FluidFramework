# Simple Component Embed

This app simply embeds another chaincode. It's meant for reference and not practical purposes.

**NOTE that this demo is on 0.2.0 of Prague. This is required if you want to load 0.2.0 components in your component.**

## Steps

`npm install` the component you want to embed. This is because you'll need type references to this component even if you are dynamically loading it.
