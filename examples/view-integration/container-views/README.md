# @fluid-example/app-integration-container-views

**Dice Roller** is a basic example that has a die and a button. Clicking the button re-rolls the die and persists the value in the root SharedDirectory.

This implementation demonstrates plugging the container into a standalone application, rather than using the webpack-fluid-loader environment that most of our packages use. This implementation relies on [Tinylicious](/server/tinylicious), so there are a few extra steps to get started. We expect the container to respond with a mountable view that we can use for rendering.

## Getting Started

You can run this example using the following steps:

1. Enable [corepack](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v16.x/api/corepack.html) by running `corepack enable`.
1. Run `pnpm install` and `pnpm run build:fast --nolint` from the `FluidFramework` root directory.
    - For an even faster build, you can add the package name to the build command, like this:
      `pnpm run build:fast --nolint @fluid-example/app-integration-container-views`
1. In a separate terminal, start a Tinylicious server by following the instructions in [Tinylicious](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/tree/main/server/tinylicious).
1. Run `pnpm start` from this directory and open <http://localhost:8080> in a web browser to see the app running.

## Testing

```bash
    npm run test:jest
```

For in browser testing update `./jest-puppeteer.config.js` to:

```javascript
  launch: {
    dumpio: true, // output browser console to cmd line
    slowMo: 500,
    headless: false,
  },
```

## Data model

Dice Roller uses the following distributed data structures:

-   SharedDirectory - root
