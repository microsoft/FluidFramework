# @fluid-example/example-webpack-integration

This package contains webpack configuration used by Fluid examples in the FluidFramework repo. These may only be used in the examples, and are not intended for use in production scenarios.

To use this package in an example, you must integrate the following into the webpack config:

1. Call `createExampleDriverServiceWebpackPlugin(service)`, which will return a webpack plugin to include. Service must be one of `"t9s"`, `"odsp"`, or `"local"`.  You may want to take this from the environment, such that you can choose the service when starting the dev server.

`webpack.config.cjs`:
```cjs
module.exports = (env) => {
	const { service } = env;

	return {
		// ...
		plugins: [
			// ...
			createExampleDriverServiceWebpackPlugin(service),
		],
		// ...
	};
}
```

`package.json`:
```json
"start": "npm run start:t9s",
"start:local": "webpack serve --env service=local",
"start:odsp": "webpack serve --env service=odsp",
"start:t9s": "webpack serve --env service=t9s",
```

2. If using odsp, also call `createOdspMiddlewares()` which will return an array of additional middlewares to include in `setupMiddlewares`. Push these on to the middleware array.

`webpack.config.cjs`:
```cjs
module.exports = (env) => {
	const { service } = env;

	return {
		// ...
		devServer: {
			// ...
			setupMiddlewares: (middlewares) => {
				if (service === "odsp") {
					middlewares.push(...createOdspMiddlewares());
				}
				return middlewares;
			},
		},
		// ...
	};
}
```
