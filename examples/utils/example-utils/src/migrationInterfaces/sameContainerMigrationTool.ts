/**
 * The collaboration session may be in one of these states:
 * * collaborating - normal collaboration is ongoing.  The client may send data.
 * * proposingMigration - a proposal to migrate has been sent by the local client, but not sequenced yet.  The client doesn't strictly have to stop sending data until it goes pending.
 * * stoppingCollaboration - a proposal to migrate has been sequenced, but not accepted yet.  The client must stop sending data.
 * // TODO should there be an event here for non-summarizer clients to observe (collaborationStopped maybe) since they won't be generating the summary?
 * // TODO: "V1" and "V2" aren't really appropriate here since we don't know the actual version numbers.  Probably prefer "old"/"current" vs. "new"/"next" or something like that.
 * * generatingV1Summary - the proposal has been accepted and we have started generating the final v1 summary locally, reflecting the state at the time of the acceptance.
 * * uploadingV1Summary - the final v1 summary has been generated locally and the local client is in the process of uploading it to the service.
 * * submittingV1Summary - the final v1 summary has been uploaded by the local client and is sending the summarize op, awaiting its summaryAck.
 * * proposingV2Code - the local client is in the process of proposing v2 code
 * * waitingForV2ProposalCompletion - at least one v2 code proposal has been approved, and we are waiting on remaining outstanding proposals to be approved.
 * * readyForMigration - awaiting a call to migrationTool.finalizeTransform(v2Summary)
 * * uploadingV2Summary - similar to above
 * * submittingV2Summary - similar to above
 * * migrated - migration has completed, if the client reloads from the latest summary they will be on v2.
