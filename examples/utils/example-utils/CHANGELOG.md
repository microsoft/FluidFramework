### Minor Changes

-   @fluidframework/view-interfaces package removed ([#19713](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/issues/19713)) [e0205c0051](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/e0205c00515d24808a4cca389b0303fc6d016b27)

    The view-interfaces package has been removed without replacement. The mountable view interfaces have been moved to the example-utils directory of the FluidFramework repo and may be used as a reference if needed, though this pattern is not recommended.

-   @fluid-experimental/react-inputs removed ([#19902](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/issues/19902)) [a7abf126ad](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/a7abf126ad964dfe3e4894bdad90ab98f8421cfd)

    This package was experimental and has been removed. No replacement is provided, but the patterns from the example packages can be used to instruct binding to a view.

-   @fluid-tools/webpack-fluid-loader no longer published ([#19660](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/issues/19660)) [9030c2c57c](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/9030c2c57c7e19ed2ae8603d2a09b519f5969592)

    The @fluid-tools/webpack-fluid-loader package is no longer published as it is not a recommended pattern. Please consult fluidframework.com for current example patterns.

-   @fluidframework/view-adapters package removed ([#19621](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/issues/19621)) [fbde842dbc](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/fbde842dbc089ecda66ab0353cc67aa96fa19c31)

    The view-adapters package has been removed without replacement. The `MountableView` class has been moved to the example-utils directory of the FluidFramework repo and may be used as a reference if needed, though this pattern is not recommended.
