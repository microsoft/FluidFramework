The next steps in LLM/AI based collaborative experiences with applications involves
allowing LLM's to propose updates to application state directly.

## The classic LLM developer experience & it's problems

The classic LLm dev exeperience involves crafting a prompt for an an LLM with some information about your ap, then having the LLM response in a parseable format.

From here the developer needs to:
1. Translate & interpet the LLM response format so it can be applied to their application state
2. Deal with potentially invalid responses
3. Deal with merging LLM responses that use potentially stale state into their apps.
    - This in particular comes into play with more dynamic application state, for example some kind of a list that users can add & remove from. You'll need to make sure the LLM isn't trying to delete something that doesn't exist or overwrite something that no longer makes sense.
4. Try to preview LLM changes to the user before accepting them. This requires maintaining a pre change branch, merged branched and post change branch

Scenario: say you want an llm to make offline changes

### How this library fixes things

Newer LLM developer tooling has solved issue #1 in a variety of ways, getting the LLM to respond with a format that you can merge into your app and ensuring that the JSON response schema is valid. However, problems 3-4 still exist and the current landscape requires bespoke, per-app solutions for dealing with this. This library simplifies these issues.
