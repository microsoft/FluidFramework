# @fluid-example/tree-cli-app

Example application using Shared-Tree to create a non-collaborative file editing CLI application.

Note that it's perfectly possible to write a collaborative online CLI app using tree as well: this simply is not an example of that.

Run the app with `pnpm run app` after building.
