# @fluid-example/external-storage

## Getting Started

You can run this example using the following steps:

1. Run `pnpm install` and `pnpm run build:fast --nolint` from the `FluidFramework` root directory.
    - For an even faster build, you can add the package name to the build command, like this:
      `pnpm run build:fast --nolint @fluid-example/external-storage`
2. In a separate terminal, start a Tinylicious server by following the instructions in [Tinylicious](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/tree/main/server/tinylicious).
3. Run `pnpm start` from this directory and open <http://localhost:8080> in a web browser to see the app running.
