# @fluid-example/presence-tracker

**_This demo is a work-in-progress_**

**Presence Tracker** is an example that demonstrates how the @fluidframework/presence package can be used to share data
that does not require persistence between clients. The presence APIs are especially suited to data like real-time cursor
positions, mouse pointer positions, and object selection.

In this example, presence is used to share both mouse position within the application window and the focus state of the
application.

This implementation visualizes the Container in a standalone application, rather than using the webpack-fluid-loader
environment that most of our examples use. This implementation relies on
[Tinylicious](/server/routerlicious/packages/tinylicious), so there are a few extra steps to get started. We bring our
own view that we bind to the data in the container.

## Getting Started

You can run this example using the following steps:

1. Enable [corepack](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v16.x/api/corepack.html) by running `corepack enable`.
1. Run `pnpm install` and `pnpm run build:fast --nolint` from the `FluidFramework` root directory.
    - For an even faster build, you can add the package name to the build command, like this:
      `pnpm run build:fast --nolint @fluid-example/presence-tracker`
1. In a separate terminal, start a Tinylicious server by following the instructions in [Tinylicious](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/tree/main/server/routerlicious/packages/tinylicious).
1. Run `pnpm start` from this directory and open <http://localhost:8080> in a web browser to see the app running.

## Tests

The tests in this example require that tinylicious be running. The tests run against the "real app" running in Webpack's
dev server and tinylicious is triggered in the background as part of the test invocation.

### Multiple browser clients

The presence APIs do not broadcast state unless multiple clients are connected, so it is necessary to run multiple
clients to test that the presence data is correctly being exchanged between clients. The tests do this by creating
multiple puppeteer clients and pointing them to the same URL. This partially works. However, the most crucial test,
which verifies that changes from one client are reflected on the other, does not yet pass, and is thus skipped. See
AB#28502 (https://dev.azure.com/fluidframework/internal/_workitems/edit/28502)
for more details.
