# @fluid-example/likes-and-comments

**Like and Comments** is a Fluid object that displays how to use a combination of Fluid DDS hooks and local React hooks together.
It uses a SharedString, SharedCounter, and a SharedObjectSequence as part of its synced state. This shows how a React view can access multiple DDSes without any handlers or event listeners by accessing the respective synced hooks: useSyncedString, useSyncedCounter, and useSyncedArray.

## Getting Started

You can run this example using the following steps:

1. Run `npm install` and `npm run build:fast -- --nolint` from the `FluidFramework` root directory.
   a. For an even faster build, you can add the package name to the build command, like this:
      `npm run build:fast -- --nolint @fluid-example/likes-and-comments`
1. In a separate terminal, start a Tinylicious server by following the instructions in [Tinylicious](../../../server/tinylicious).
1. Run `npm run start` from this directory (examples/apps/likes-and-comments) and open <http://localhost:8080> in a web browser to see the app running.

## Files

#### app.tsx
This is the main file that starts running the likes-and-comments app. It fetches the container for the Fluid object the app is using and proceeds to render the object on the browser at localhost:8080, and uses the locally running Tinylicious server instance.

#### container.ts
This is where the likes-and-comments Fluid object registry entry is added to the container and a data store for it is generated.

#### fluidObject.tsx
This contains the actual definition for the Fluid object that the app is using. It extends the `SyncedDataObject` class and defines the DDSes that will be needed in the configuration set in the constructor. It then passes these DDSes to the view to consume the data in the `render` function. This is the `render` that is ultimately being called in `app.tsx` to view the Fluid object.

#### view.tsx
The functional React view responsible for rendering the data provided by the Fluid object. It fetches the configured DDSes using the provided synced hooks.

#### utils.ts
Helper functions for the app.
