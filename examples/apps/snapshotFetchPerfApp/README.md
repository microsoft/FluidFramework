## Getting Started

You can run this example using the following steps:

1. Run `npm install` and `npm run build:fast -- --nolint` from the `FluidFramework` root directory.
    - For an even faster build, you can add the package name to the build command, like this:
      `npm run build:fast -- --nolint @fluid-example/odspsnapshotfetch-perftestapp`
1. Run `npm run start` from this directory (examples/data-objects/smde) and open <http://localhost:8080> in a web browser to see the app running.

After that you can paste the url of the doc and click fetch snapshot and you will see the fields of "TreesLatest_end"
event getting populated in the table. The result will be of 5 runs.
