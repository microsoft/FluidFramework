# @fluid-example/todo

**Todo** is a more advanced example that covers more complicated scenarios. The Todo app uses React as it's view rendering platform.

![Todo Example](./resources/todo-screen-capture.gif)

## Getting Started

If you want to run this example follow the following steps:

1. Run `npm install` from the `FluidFramework` root directory
2. Navigate to this directory
3. Run `npm run start`

## Todo Fluid Objects

There are two Fluid objects that make up the Todo application:

### [Todo](./src/Todo/index.tsx)

A Todo is the top level Fluid object and contains three core concepts:

1. Title
2. Ability to create new Todo Items
3. Collection of Todo Items

### [TodoItem](./src/TodoItem/index.tsx)

A Todo Item is a singular todo entry. Because each Todo Item is its own Fluid object each Todo Item can be independently opened.

Todo Items can contain one inner Fluid object. These can currently be another Todo Item or a Clicker.

## Other Fluid Objects

There are two other Fluid objects that live in the todo repo but are there to extend functionality of `TodoItem`

### [TextBox](./src/TextBox/index.tsx)

A Collaborative TextArea based off the React CollaborativeTextArea. This should be replaced by just pulling in the `@fluid-example/collaborative-textarea` Fluid objects.

### [TextList](./src/TextList/index.tsx)

Used the `SharedString` to manage a list of text items.
