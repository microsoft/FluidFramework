# @fluid-example/prosemirror

An experimental implementation of how to take the open source [ProseMirror](https://prosemirror.net/) rich text editor and
enable real-time coauthoring using the Fluid Framework.

## Getting Started

If you want to run this example follow the following steps:

1. Run `npm install` from the `FluidFramework` root directory
2. Navigate to this directory
3. Run `npm run start`

## Data model

ProseMirror uses the following distributed data structures:

- SharedDirectory - root
- SharedString - storing ProseMirror text

## Known Issues

This implementation stores the HTML output of the ProseMirror editor onto the SharedString. While this enables
collaboration it does not provide for a complete editor. Because rich editing features (ex. bold/italic) are stored
as HTML tags along with the text this can cause conflicts with multiple users applying conflicting styles resulting
in lost opening/closure tags.

A more complete solution would use the SharedString property bag to apply styles across text ranges. This allows for
styles to be merged in a more deterministic way.
