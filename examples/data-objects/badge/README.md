## Getting Started

You can run this example using the following steps:

1. Run `npm install` and `npm run build:fast -- --nolint` from the `FluidFramework` root directory.
   a. For an even faster build, you can add the package name to the build command, like this:
      `npm run build:fast -- --nolint @fluid-example/badge`
1. Run `npm run start` from this directory (examples/data-objects/badge) and open <http://localhost:8080> in a web browser to see the app running.

## Custom Status

Badge includes four preset statuses: Drafting, Reviewing, Complete, and Archived.

You can also set a custom status with any text or color.

## History

The history of the Badge is also shown on hover, so users can see how the status has evolved over time.

## Data model

Badge uses the following distributed data structures:

- SharedDirectory - root
- SharedMap - stores the status options for the Badge
- SharedCell - represents the Badge's current state
- SharedObjectSequence - stores the history of status changes
