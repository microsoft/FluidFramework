# @fluid-example/task-selection

The task selection example demonstrates a couple different ways to pick a single client amongst the connected clients to perform a task (in this case, rolling a dice once per second).  This builds upon the external-views sample as a base.

## Getting Started

You can run this example using the following steps:

1. Run `npm install` and `npm run build:fast -- --nolint` from the `FluidFramework` root directory.
   a. For an even faster build, you can add the package name to the build command, like this:
      `npm run build:fast -- --nolint @fluid-example/task-selection`
1. In a separate terminal, start a Tinylicious server by following the instructions in [Tinylicious](../../../server/tinylicious).
1. Run `npm run start` from this directory (examples/data-objects/task-selection) and open <http://localhost:8080> in a web browser to see the app running.

## Testing

```bash
    npm run test:jest
```

For in browser testing update `./jest-puppeteer.config.js` to:

```javascript
  launch: {
    dumpio: true, // output browser console to cmd line
    slowMo: 500,
    headless: false,
  },
```
