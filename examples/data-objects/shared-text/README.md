## Getting Started

You can run this example using the following steps:

1. Install [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) by running `npm i -g pnpm`.
1. Run `pnpm install` and `npm run build:fast -- --nolint` from the `FluidFramework` root directory.
    - For an even faster build, you can add the package name to the build command, like this:
      `npm run build:fast -- --nolint @fluid-example/shared-text`
1. Run `npm start` from this directory (examples/data-objects/shared-text) and open <http://localhost:8080> in a web browser to see the app running.
