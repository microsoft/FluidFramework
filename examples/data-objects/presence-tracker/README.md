# @fluid-example/presence-tracker

**_This demo is a work-in-progress_**

**Presence Tracker** is an example that demonstrates how transient state of audience members can be tracked among other audience members using signals.  It does so using fluid-framework's `FluidContainer`, `IServiceAudience`, and `SignalManager`.

This implementation visualizes the Container in a standalone application, rather than using the webpack-fluid-loader environment that most of our examples use.  This implementation relies on [Tinylicious](/server/tinylicious), so there are a few extra steps to get started.  We bring our own view that we will bind to the data in the container.

## Getting Started

You can run this example using the following steps:

1. Run `npm install` and `npm run build:fast -- --nolint` from the `FluidFramework` root directory.
   a. For an even faster build, you can add the package name to the build command, like this:
      `npm run build:fast -- --nolint @fluid-example/presence-tracker`
1. In a separate terminal, start a Tinylicious server by following the instructions in [Tinylicious](../../../server/tinylicious).
1. Run `npm run start` from this directory (examples/data-objects/presence-tracker) and open <http://localhost:8080> in a web browser to see the app running.
