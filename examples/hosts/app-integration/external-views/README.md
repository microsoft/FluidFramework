# @fluid-example/app-integration-external-views

**Dice Roller** is a basic example that has a die and a button. Clicking the button re-rolls the die and persists the value in the root SharedDirectory. The Fluid Container is defined in container/, the data object is defined in dataObject/.

This implementation demonstrates plugging that Container into a standalone application, rather than using the webpack-fluid-loader environment that most of our packages use.  This implementation relies on [Tinylicious](/server/tinylicious), so there are a few extra steps to get started.  We bring our own view that we will bind to the data in the container.

## Testing

```bash
    npm run test:jest
```

For in browser testing update `./jest-puppeteer.config.js` to:

```javascript
  launch: {
    dumpio: true, // output browser console to cmd line
    slowMo: 500,
    headless: false,
  },
```

## Data model

Dice Roller uses the following distributed data structures:

- SharedDirectory - root
