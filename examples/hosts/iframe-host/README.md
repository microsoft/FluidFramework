# @fluid-example/iframe-host

An experimental host to test isolating containers in IFrames.

Some usage notes:
- When running `npm start`, tinylicious is expected to be running on port 3000.  This is its default port when run from its package directory in the server repo.
- This package uses the `debug` package for debug logging.  To turn it on in the browser, set `localStorage.debug = "fluid:iframe-socket-storage"` in the browser console.
