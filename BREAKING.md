- [Refactored token fetcher types in odsp-driver](#refactored-token-fetcher-types-in-odsp-driver)

### Removed-some-api-implementations-from-odsp-driver
Removed `authorizedFetchWithRetry`, `AuthorizedRequestTokenPolicy`, `AuthorizedFetchProps`, `asyncWithCache`, `asyncWithRetry`,
`fetchWithRetry` implementation from odspdriver.

### get-tinylicious-container and get-session-storage-container moved
The functionality from the packages `@fluidframework/get-tinylicious-container` and `@fluidframework/get-session-storage-container` has been moved to the package `@fluid-experimental/get-container`.

### Moved parseAuthErrorClaims from @fluidframework/odsp-driver to @fluidframework/odsp-doclib-utils
Moved `parseAuthErrorClaims` from `@fluidframework/odsp-driver` to `@fluidframework/odsp-doclib-utils`

## Refactored token fetcher types in odsp-driver
Streamlined interfaces and types used to facilitate access tokens needed by odsp-driver to call ODSP implementation of Fluid services.
Added support for passing siteUrl when fetching token that is used to establish co-authoring session for Fluid content stored in ODSP file which is hosted in external tenant. This token is used by ODSP ordering service implementation (aka ODSP Push service).

## 0.34 Breaking changes
- [Aqueduct writeBlob() and BlobHandle implementation removed](#Aqueduct-writeBlob-and-BlobHandle-implementation-removed)
- [Connected events raised on registration](#Connected-events-raised-on-registration)

### Aqueduct writeBlob() and BlobHandle implementation removed
`writeBlob()` and `BlobHandle` have been removed from aqueduct. Please use `FluidDataStoreRuntime.uploadBlob()` or `ContainerRuntime.uploadBlob()` instead.

### Connected events raised on registration
Connected / disconnected listeners are called on registration.
Pleas see [Connectivity events](packages/loader/container-loader/README.md#Connectivity-events) section of Loader readme.md for more details

## 0.33 Breaking changes
- [Normalizing enum ContainerErrorType](#normalizing-enum-containererrortype)
- [Map and Directory typing changes from enabling strictNullCheck](#map-and-directory-typing-changes-from-enabling-strictNullCheck)
- [MergeTree's ReferencePosition.getTileLabels and ReferencePosition.getRangeLabels() return undefined if it doesn't exist](#mergetree-referenceposition-gettilelabels-getrangelabels-changes)
- [Containers from Loader.request() are now cached by default](#Containers-from-Loader.request()-are-now-cached-by-default)

### Normalizing enum ContainerErrorType
In an effort to clarify error categorization, a name and value in this enumeration were changed.

### Map and Directory typing changes from enabling strictNullCheck
Typescript compile options `strictNullCheck` is enabled for the `@fluidframework/map` package. Some of the API signature is updated to include possibility of `undefined` and `null`, which can cause new typescript compile error when upgrading.  Existing code may need to update to handle the possiblity of `undefined` or `null.

### MergeTree ReferencePosition getTileLabels getRangeLabels changes
This includes LocalReference and Marker.  getTileLabels and getRangeLabels methods will return undefined instead of creating an empty if the properties for tile labels and range labels is not set.

### Containers from Loader.request() are now cached by default
Some loader request header options that previously prevented caching (`pause: true` and `reconnect: false`) no longer do.  Callers must now explicitly spcify `cache: false` in the request header to prevent caching of the returned container.  Containers are evicted from the cache in their `closed` event, and closed containers that are requested are not cached.

## 0.32 Breaking changes
- [Node version 12.17 required](#Node-version-update)
- [getAttachSnapshot removed IFluidDataStoreChannel](#getAttachSnapshot-removed-from-IFluidDataStoreChannel)
- [resolveDataStore replaced](#resolveDataStore-replaced)

### Node version updated to 12.17
Due to changes in server packages and introduction of AsyncLocalStorage module which requires Node version 12.17 or above, you will need to update Node version to 12.17 or above.

### getAttachSnapshot removed from IFluidDataStoreChannel
`getAttachSnapshot()` has been removed from `IFluidDataStoreChannel`. It is replaced by `getAttachSummary()`.

### resolveDataStore replaced
The resolveDataStore method manually exported by the ODSP resolver has been replaced with checkUrl() from the same package.

## 0.30 Breaking Changes

- [Branching removed](#Branching-removed)
- [removeAllEntriesForDocId api name and signature change](#removeAllEntriesForDocId-api-name-and-signature-change)
- [snapshot removed from IChannel and ISharedObject](#snapshot-removed-from-IChannel-and-ISharedObject)

### Branching removed
The branching feature has been removed. This includes all related members, methods, etc. such as `parentBranch`, `branchId`, `branch()`, etc.

### removeAllEntriesForDocId api name and signature change
`removeAllEntriesForDocId` api renamed to `removeEntries`. Now it takes `IFileEntry` as argument instead of just docId.

### snapshot removed from IChannel and ISharedObject
`snapshot` has been removed from `IChannel` and `ISharedObject`. It is replaced by `summarize` which should be used to get a summary of the channel / shared object.

## 0.29 Breaking Changes

- [OdspDriverUrlResolver2 renamed to OdspDriverUrlResolverForShareLink](#OdspDriverUrlResolver2-renamed-to-OdspDriverUrlResolverForShareLink)
- [removeAllEntriesForDocId api in host storage changed](#removeAllEntriesForDocId-api-in-host-storage-changed)

- [FluidDataStoreRuntime.registerRequestHandler deprecated](#FluidDataStoreRuntime.registerRequestHandler-deprecated)
- [snapshot removed from IFluidDataStoreRuntime](#snapshot-removed-from-IFluidDataStoreRuntime)
- [getAttachSnapshot deprecated in IFluidDataStoreChannel](#getAttachSnapshot-deprecated-in-IFluidDataStoreChannel)

### OdspDriverUrlResolver2 renamed to OdspDriverUrlResolverForShareLink
`OdspDriverUrlResolver2` renamed to `OdspDriverUrlResolverForShareLink`

### removeAllEntriesForDocId api in host storage changed
`removeAllEntriesForDocId` api in host storage is now an async api.

### IContainerRuntimeBase.IProvideFluidDataStoreRegistry
`IProvideFluidDataStoreRegistry` implementation moved from IContainerRuntimeBase to IContainerRuntime. Data stores and objects should not have access to global state in container.
`IProvideFluidDataStoreRegistry` is removed from IFluidDataStoreChannel - it has not been implemented there for a while (it moved to context).

### _createDataStoreWithProps returns IFluidRouter
`IContainerRuntimeBase._createDataStoreWithProps` returns IFluidRouter instead of IFluidDataStoreChannel. This is done to be consistent with other APIs create data stores, and ensure we do not return internal interfaces. This likely to expose areas where IFluidDataStoreChannel.bindToContext() was called manually on data store. Such usage should be re-evaluate - lifetime management should be left up to runtime, storage of any handle form data store in attached DDS will result in automatic attachment of data store (and all of its objects) to container. If absolutely needed, and only for staging, casting can be done to implement old behavior.

### FluidDataStoreRuntime.registerRequestHandler deprecated
Please use mixinRequestHandler() as a way to create custom data store runtime  factory/object and append request handling to existing implementation.

### snapshot removed from IFluidDataStoreRuntime
`snapshot` has been removed from `IFluidDataStoreRuntime`.

### getAttachSnapshot deprecated in IFluidDataStoreChannel
`getAttachSnapshot()` has been deprecated in `IFluidDataStoreChannel`. It is replaced by `getAttachSummary()`.

## 0.28 Breaking Changes

- [ODSP status codes moved from odsp-driver to odsp-doclib-utils](#ODSP-status-codes-moved-modules-from-odsp-driver-to-odsp-doclib-utils)

### FileName should contain extension for ODSP driver create new path
Now the ODSP driver expects file extension in the file name while creating a new detached container.

### ODSP Driver IPersistedCache-Changes
Added api `removeAllEntriesForDocId` which allows removal of all entries for a given document id. Also the schema for entries stored inside odsp `IPersistedCache` has changed.
It now stores/expect values as `IPersistedCacheValueWithEpoch`. So host needs to clear its cached entries in this version.

### IFluidPackage Changes
- Moving IFluidPackage and IFluidCodeDetails from "@fluidframework/container-definitions" to '@fluidframework/core-interfaces'
- Remove npm specific IPackage interface
- Simplify the IFluidPackage by removing browser and npm specific properties
- Add new interface IFluidBrowserPackage, and isFluidBrowserPackage which defines browser specific properties
- Added resolveFluidPackageEnvironment helper for resolving a package environment

### DataObject changes
DataObject are now always created when Data Store is created. Full initialization for existing objects (in file) continues to happen to be on demand, i.e. when request() is processed. Full DataObject initialization does happen for newly created (detached) DataObjects.
The impact of that change is that all changed objects would get loaded by summarizer container, but would not get initialized. Before this change, summarizer would not be loading any DataObjects.
This change
1. Ensures that initial summary generated for when data store attaches to container has fully initialized object, with all DDSs created. Before this change this initial snapshot was empty in most cases.
2. Allows DataObjects to modify FluidDataStoreRuntime behavior before it gets registered and used by the rest of the system, including setting various hooks.

But it also puts more constraints on DataObject - its constructor should be light and not do any expensive work (all such work should be done in corresponding initialize methods), or access any data store runtime functionality that requires fully initialized runtime (like loading DDSs will not work in this state)

### RequestParser
RequestParser's ctor is made protected. Please replace this code
```
    const a = new RequestParser(request);
```
with this one:
```
    const a = RequestParser.create(request);
```

### IFluidLodable.url is removed
`url` property is removed. If you need a path to an object (in a container), you can use IFluidLoadable.handle.absolutePath instead.

### Loader Constructor Changes
The loader constructor has changed to now take a props object, rather than a series of paramaters. This should make it easier to construct loaders as the optional services can be easily excluded.

Before:
``` typescript
    const loader = new Loader(
        urlResolver,
        documentServiceFactory,
        codeLoader,
        { blockUpdateMarkers: true },
        {},
        new Map(),
    );
```

After:
``` typescript
    const loader = new Loader({
        urlResolver,
        documentServiceFactory,
        codeLoader,
    });
```

if for some reason this change causes you problems, we've added a deprecated `Loader._create` method that has the same parameters as the previous constructor which can be used in the interim.

### Moving DriverHeader and merge with CreateNewHeader
Compile time only API breaking change between runtime and driver.  Only impacts driver implementer.
No back-compat or mix version impact.

DriverHeader is a driver concept, so move from core-interface to driver-definitions. CreateNewHeader is also a kind of driver header, merged it into DriverHeader.

### ODSP status codes moved modules from odsp-driver to odsp-doclib-utils
Error/status codes like `offlineFetchFailureStatusCode` which used to be imported like `import { offlineFetchFailureStatusCode } from '@fluidframework/@odsp-driver';` have been moved to `odspErrorUtils.ts` in `odsp-doclib-utils`.

## 0.27 Breaking Changes
- [Local Web Host Removed](#Local-Web-Host-Removed)

### Local Web Host Removed
Local Web host is removed. Users who are using the local web host can use examples/utils/get-session-storage-container which provides the same functionality with the detached container flow.

## 0.25 Breaking Changes
- [External Component Loader and IComponentDefaultFactoryName removed](#External-Component-Loader-and-IComponentDefaultFactoryName-removed)
- [MockFluidDataStoreRuntime api rename](#MockFluidDataStoreRuntime-api-rename)

- [ComponentProvider renamed to FluidObjectProvider in @fluidframework/synthesize](#componentProvider-renamed-to-fluidobjectPpovider)


### External Component Loader and IComponentDefaultFactoryName removed
The @fluidframework/external-component-loader package has been removed from the repo. In addition to this, the IFluidExportDefaultFactoryName and the corresponding IProvideFluidExportDefaultFactoryName interfaces have also been dropped.

### MockFluidDataStoreRuntime api rename
Runtime Test Utils's MockFluidDataStoreRuntime now has "requestDataStore" instead of "requestComponent"

### Local Web Host API change
The renderDefaultComponent function has been updated to be renderDefaultFluidObject

### Container runtime event changes
Container runtime now emits the event "fluidDataStoreInstantiated" instead of "componentInstantiated"

### Component is removed from telemetry event names
The following telemetry event names have been updated to drop references to the term component:

ComponentRuntimeDisposeError -> ChannelDisposeError
ComponentContextDisposeError -> FluidDataStoreContextDisposeError
SignalComponentNotFound -> SignalFluidDataStoreNotFound

### IComponentContextLegacy is removed
Deprecated in 0.18, removed.

### IContainerRuntimeBase._createDataStoreWithProps is removed
**Note: This change has been reverted for 0.25 and will be pushed to a later release.**

`IContainerRuntimeBase._createDataStoreWithProps()` has been removed. Please use `IContainerRuntimeBase.createDataStore()` (returns IFluidRouter).
If you need to pass props to data store, either use request() route to pass initial props directly, or to query Fluid object to interact with it (pass props / call methods to configure object).

### _createDataStore APIs are removed
`IFluidDataStoreContext._createDataStore()` & `IContainerRuntimeBase._createDataStore()` are removed
Please switch to using one of the following APIs:
1. `IContainerRuntime.createRootDataStore()` - data store created that way is automatically bound to container. It will immediately be visible to remote clients (when/if container is attached). Such data stores are never garbage collected. Note that this API is on `IContainerRuntime` interface, which is not directly accessible to data stores. The intention is that only container owners are creating roots.
2. `IContainerRuntimeBase.createDataStore()` - creates data store that is not bound to container. In order for this store to be bound to container (and thus be observable on remote clients), ensure that handle to it (or any of its objects / DDS) is stored into any other DDS that is already bound to container. In other words, newly created data store has to be reachable (there has to be a path) from some root data store in container. If, in future, such data store becomes unreachable from one of the roots, it will be garbage collected (implementation pending).

### createDataStoreWithRealizationFn() APIs are removed
Removed from IFluidDataStoreContext  & IContainerRuntime.
Consider using (Pure)DataObject(Factory) for your objects - they support passing initial args.
Otherwise consider implementing similar flow of exposing interface from your Fluid object that is used to initialize object after creation.

## getDataStore() APIs is removed
IContainerRuntime.getDataStore() is removed. Only IContainerRuntime.getRootDataStore() is available to retrieve root data stores.
For couple versions we will allow retrieving non-root data stores using this API, but this functionality is temporary and will be removed soon.
You can use handleFromLegacyUri() for creating handles from container-internal URIs (i.e., in format `/${dataStoreId}`) and resolving those containers to get to non-root data stores. Please note that this functionality is strictly added for legacy files! In future, not using handles to refer to content (and storing handles in DDSes) will result in such data stores not being reachable from roots, and thus garbage collected (deleted) from file.

### Package Renames
As a follow up to the changes in 0.24 we are updating a number of package names
- `@fluidframework/component-core-interfaces` is renamed to `@fluidframework/core-interfaces`
- `@fluidframework/component-runtime-definitions` is renamed to `@fluidframework/datastore-definitions`
- `@fluidframework/component-runtime` is renamed to `@fluidframework/datastore`
- `@fluidframework/webpack-component-loader` is renamed to `@fluidframework/webpack-fluid-loader`

### IComponent and IComponent Interfaces Removed
In 0.24 IComponent and IComponent interfaces were deprecated, they are being removed in this build. Please move to IFluidObject and IFluidObject interfaces.

### odsp-utils Changes
To support additional authentication scenarios, the signature and/or name of a few auth-related functions was modified.

### LastEditedTrackerComponent renamed
It is renamed to LastEditedTrackerDataObject

### ComponentProvider renamed to FluidObjectProvider

In the package @fluidframework/synthesize, these types are renamed:

ComponentKey -> FluidObjectKey
ComponentSymbolProvider -> FluidObjectProvider
AsyncRequiredcomponentProvider -> AsyncRequiredFluidObjectProvider
AsyncOptionalComponentProvider -> AsyncOptionalFluidObjectProvider
AsyncComponentProvider -> AsyncFluidObjectProvider
NonNullableComponent -> NonNullableFluidObject

## 0.24 Breaking Changes
This release only contains renames. There are no functional changes in this release. You should ensure you have integrated and validated up to release 0.23 before integrating this release.

This is a followup to the forward compat added in release 0.22: [Forward Compat For Loader IComponent Interfaces](#Forward-Compat-For-Loader-IComponent-Interfaces)

You should ensure all container and components hosts are running at least 0.22 before integrating this release.

The below json describes all the renames done in this release. If you have a large typescript code base, we have automation that may help. Please contact us if that is the case.

All renames are 1-1, and global case senstive and whole word find replace for all should be safe. For IComponent Interfaces, both the type and property name were re-named.

## 0.23 Breaking Changes
- [Removed `collaborating` event on IComponentRuntime](#Removed-`collaborating`-event-on-IComponentRuntime)
- [ISharedObjectFactory rename](#ISharedObjectFactory)
- [LocalSessionStorageDbFactory moved to @fluidframework/local-driver](LocalSessionStorageDbFactory-moved-to-@fluidframework/local-driver)

### Removed `collaborating` event on IComponentRuntime
Component Runtime no longer fires the collaborating event on attaching. Now it fires `attaching` event.

### ISharedObjectFactory
`ISharedObjectFactory` renamed to `IChannelFactory` and moved from `@fluidframework/shared-object-base` to `@fluidframework/datastore-definitions`

### LocalSessionStorageDbFactory moved to @fluidframework/local-driver
Previously, `LocalSessionStorageDbFactory` was part of the `@fluidframework/webpack-component-loader` package.  It has been moved to the `@fluidframework/local-driver` package.

## 0.22 Breaking Changes
- [Deprecated `path` from `IComponentHandleContext`](#Deprecated-`path`-from-`IComponentHandleContext`)
- [Dynamically loaded components compiled against older versions of runtime](#Dynamically-loaded-components)
- [ContainerRuntime.load Request Handler Changes](#ContainerRuntime.load-Request-Handler-Changes)
- [IComponentHTMLVisual removed](#IComponentHTMLVisual-removed)
- [IComponentReactViewable deprecated](#IComponentReactViewable-deprecated)
- [Forward Compat For Loader IComponent Interfaces](#Forward-Compat-For-Loader-IComponent-Interfaces)
- [Add Undefined to getAbsoluteUrl return type](#Add-Undefined-to-getAbsoluteUrl-return-type)
- [Renamed TestDeltaStorageService, TestDocumentDeltaConnection, TestDocumentService, TestDocumentServiceFactory and TestResolver](#Renamed-TestDeltaStorageService,-TestDocumentDeltaConnection,-TestDocumentService,-TestDocumentServiceFactory-and-TestResolver)
- [DocumentDeltaEventManager has been renamed and moved to "@fluidframework/test-utils"](#DocumentDeltaEventManager-has-been-renamed-and-moved-to-"@fluidframework/test-utils")
- [`isAttached` replaced with `attachState` property](#`isAttached`-replaced-with-`attachState`-property)

### Deprecated `path` from `IComponentHandleContext`
Deprecated the `path` field from the interface `IComponentHandleContext`. This means that `IComponentHandle` will not have this going forward as well.

Added an `absolutePath` field to `IComponentHandleContext` which is the absolute path to reach it from the container runtime.

### Dynamically loaded components
Components that were compiled against Fluid Framework <= 0.19.x releases will fail to load. A bunch of APIs has been deprecated in 0.20 & 0.21 and back compat support is being removed in 0.22. Some of the key APIs are:
   - IComponentRuntime.attach
   - ContainerContext.isAttached
   - ContainerContext.isLocal
Such components needs to be compiled against >= 0.21 runtime and can be used in container that is built using >= 0.21 runtime as well.

### ContainerRuntime.load Request Handler Changes
ContainerRuntime.load no longer accepts an array of RuntimeRequestHandlers. It has been changed to a single function parameter with a compatible signature:
`requestHandler?: (request: IRequest, runtime: IContainerRuntime) => Promise<IResponse>`

 To continue to use RuntimeRequestHandlers you can used the `RuntimeRequestHandlerBuilder` in the package `@fluidframework/request-handler`

example:
``` typescript
    const builder = new RuntimeRequestHandlerBuilder();
    builder.pushHandler(...this.requestHandlers);
    builder.pushHandler(defaultRouteRequestHandler("defaultComponent"));
    builder.pushHandler(innerRequestHandler());

    const runtime = await ContainerRuntime.load(
        context,
        this.registryEntries,
        async (req,rt) => builder.handleRequest(req, rt),
        undefined,
        scope);
```

Additionally the class `RequestParser` has been moved to the `@fluidframework/runtime-utils` package

This will allow consumers of our ContainerRuntime to substitute other routing frameworks more easily.

### IComponentHTMLVisual removed
The `IComponentHTMLVisual` interface was deprecated in 0.21, and is now removed in 0.22.  To support multiview scenarios, consider split view/model patterns like those demonstrated in the multiview sample.

### IComponentReactViewable deprecated
The `IComponentReactViewable` interface is deprecated and will be removed in an upcoming release.  For multiview scenarios, instead use a pattern like the one demonstrated in the sample in /components/experimental/multiview.  This sample demonstrates how to create multiple views for a component.


### Forward Compat For Loader IComponent Interfaces

As part of the Fluid Data Library (FDL) and Fluid Component Library (FCL) split we will be renaming a significant number of out interfaces. Some of these interfaces are used across the loader -> runtime boundary. For these interfaces we have introduced the newly renamed interfaces in this release. This will allow Host's to implment forward compatbitiy for these interfaces, so they are not broken when the implementations themselves are renamed.

- `IComponentLastEditedTracker` will become `IFluidLastEditedTracker`
- `IComponentHTMLView` will become `IFluidHTMLView`
- `IComponentMountableViewClass` will become `IFluidMountableViewClass`
- `IComponentLoadable` will become `IFluidLoadable`
- `IComponentRunnable` will become `IFluidRunnable`
- `IComponentConfiguration` will become `IFluidConfiguration`
- `IComponentRouter` will become `IFluidRouter`
- `IComponentHandleContext` will become `IFluidHandleContext`
- `IComponentHandle` will become `IFluidHandle`
- `IComponentSerializer `will become `IFluidSerializer`
- `IComponentTokenProvider` will become `IFluidTokenProvider`

`IComponent` will also become `IFluidObject`, and the mime type for for requests will change from `fluid/component` to `fluid/object`

To ensure forward compatability when accessing the above interfaces outside the context of a container e.g. from the host, you should use the nullish coalesing operator (??).

For example
``` typescript
        if (response.status !== 200 ||
            !(
                response.mimeType === "fluid/component" ||
                response.mimeType === "fluid/object"
            )) {
            return undefined;
        }

        const fluidObject = response.value as IComponent & IFluidObject;
        return fluidObject.IComponentHTMLView ?? fluidObject.IFluidHTMLView.

```

### Add Undefined to getAbsoluteUrl return type

getAbsoluteUrl on the container runtime and component context now returns `string | undefined`. `undefined` will be returned if the container or component is not attached. You can determine if  a component is attached and get its url with the below snippit:
```typescript
import { waitForAttach } from "@fluidframework/aqueduct";


protected async hasInitialized() {
        waitForAttach(this.runtime)
            .then(async () => {
                const url = await this.context.getAbsoluteUrl(this.url);
                this._absoluteUrl = url;
                this.emit("stateChanged");
            })
            .catch(console.error);
}
```

### Renamed TestDeltaStorageService, TestDocumentDeltaConnection, TestDocumentService, TestDocumentServiceFactory and TestResolver

Renamed the following in "@fluidframework/local-driver" since these are used beyond testing:
- `TestDeltaStorageService` -> `LocalDeltaStorageService`
- `TestDocumentDeltaConnection` -> `LocalDocumentDeltaConnection`
- `TestDocumentService` -> `LocalDocumentService`
- `TestDocumentServiceFactory` -> `LocalDocumentServiceFactory`
- `TestResolver` -> `LocalResolver`

### DocumentDeltaEventManager has been renamed and moved to "@fluidframework/test-utils"

`DocumentDeltaEventManager` has moved to "@fluidframework/test-utils" and renamed to `OpProcessingController`.

The `registerDocuments` method has been renamed to `addDeltaManagers` and should be called with a list of delta managers. Similarly, all the other methods have been updated to be called with delta managers.

So, the usage has now changed to pass in the deltaManager from the object that was passed earlier. For example:

```typescript
// Old usage
containerDeltaEventManager = new DocumentDeltaEventManager(deltaConnectionServer);
containerDeltaEventManager.registerDocuments(component1.runtime, component2.runtime);

// New usage
opProcessingController = new OpProcessingController(deltaConnectionServer);
opProcessingController.addDeltaManagers(component1.runtime.deltaManager, component2.runtime.deltaManager);
```

### `isAttached` replaced with `attachState` property

`isAttached` is replaced with `attachState` property on `IContainerContext`, `IContainerRuntime` and `IComponentContext`.
`isAttached` returned true when the entity was either attaching or attached to the storage.
So if `attachState` is `AttachState.Attaching` or `AttachState.Attached` then `isAttached` would have returned true.
Attaching is introduced in regards to Detached container where there is a time where state is neither AttachState.Detached nor AttachState.Attached.

## 0.21 Breaking Changes
- [Removed `@fluidframework/local-test-utils`](#removed-`@fluidframework/local-test-utils`)
- [IComponentHTMLVisual deprecated](#IComponentHTMLVisual-deprecated)
- [createValueType removed from SharedMap and SharedDirectory](#createValueType-removed-from-SharedMap-and-SharedDirectory)
- [Sequence snapshot format change](#Sequence-snapshot-format-change)
- [isLocal api removed](#isLocal-api-removed)
- [register/attach api renames on handles, components and dds](#register/attach-api-rename-on-handles,-components-and-dds)
- [Error handling changes](#Error-handling-changes)

### Removed `@fluidframework/local-test-utils`
Removed this package so classes like `TestHost` are no longer supported. Please contact us if there were dependencies on this or if any assistance in required to get rid of it.

### IComponentHTMLVisual deprecated
The `IComponentHTMLVisual` interface is deprecated and will be removed in an upcoming release.  For multiview scenarios, instead use a pattern like the one demonstrated in the sample in /components/experimental/multiview.  This sample demonstrates how to create multiple views for a component.

### createValueType removed from SharedMap and SharedDirectory
The `createValueType()` method on `SharedMap` and `SharedDirectory` was deprecated in 0.20, and is now removed in 0.21.  If `Counter` functionality is required, the `@fluidframework/counter` DDS can be used for counter functionality.

### isLocal api removed
isLocal api is removed from the repo. It is now replaced with isAttached which tells that the entity is attached or getting attached to storage. So its meaning is opposite to isLocal.

### register/attach api renames on handles, components and dds
Register on dds and attach on data store runtime is renamed to bindToContext(). attach on handles is renamed to attachGraph().

### Error handling changes
ErrorType enum has been broken into 3 distinct enums / layers:
1. [ContainerErrorType](./packages/loader/container-definitions/src/error.ts) - errors & warnings raised at loader level
2. [OdspErrorType](./packages/drivers/odsp-driver/src/odspError.ts) and [R11sErrorType](./packages/drivers/routerlicious-driver/src/documentDeltaConnection.ts) - errors raised by ODSP and R11S drivers.
3. Runtime errors, like ```"summarizingError"```, ```"dataCorruptionError"```. This class of errors it not pre-determined and depends on type of container loaded.

[ICriticalContainerError.errorType](./packages/loader/container-definitions/src/error.ts) is now a string, not enum, as loader has no visibility into full set of errors that can be potentially raised. Hosting application may package different drivers and open different types of containers, thus making errors list raised at container level dynamic.

### Sequence snapshot format change

Due to a change in the sequence's snapshot format clients running a version less than 0.19 will not be able to load snapshots generated in 0.21. This will affect all sequence types includes shared string, and sparse matrix. If you need to support pre-0.19 clients please contact us for mitigations.


## 0.20 Breaking Changes
- [Value types deprecated on SharedMap and SharedDirectory](#Value-types-deprecated-on-sharedmap-and-shareddirectory)
- [rename @fluidframework/aqueduct-react to @fluidframework/react-inputs](#rename-@fluidframework/aqueduct-react-to-@fluidframework/react-inputs)

### Value types deprecated on SharedMap and SharedDirectory
The `Counter` value type and `createValueType()` method on `SharedMap` and `SharedDirectory` are now deprecated and will be removed in an upcoming release.  Instead, the `@fluidframework/counter` DDS can be used for counter functionality.

### rename @fluidframework/aqueduct-react to @fluidframework/react-inputs

aqueduct-react is actually just a react library and renamed it to reflect such.

## 0.19 Breaking Changes
- [Container's "error" event](#Container-Error-Event)
- [IUrlResolver change from requestUrl to getAbsoluteUrl](#IUrlResolver-change-from-requestUrl-to-getAbsoluteUrl)
- [Package rename from `@microsoft/fluid-*` to `@fluidframework/*`](#package-rename)

### Package rename
Package with the prefix "@microsoft/fluid-" is renamed to "@fluidframework/" to take advanage a separate namespace for Fluid Framework SDK packages.

### Container Error Event
"error" event is gone. All critical errors are raised on "closed" event via optiona error object.
"warning" event is added to expose warnings. Currently it contains summarizer errors and throttling errors.

### IUrlResolver change from requestUrl to getAbsoluteUrl
As we continue to refine our API around detached containers, and component urls, we've renamed IUrlResolver from requestUrl to getAbsoluteUrl

## 0.18 Breaking Changes

- [App Id removed as a parameter to OdspDocumentServiceFactory](#App-Id-removed-as-a-parameter-to-OdspDocumentServiceFactory)
- [ConsensusRegisterCollection now supports storing handles](#ConsensusRegisterCollection-now-supports-storing-handles)
- [Summarizing errors on parent container](#Summarizing-errors-on-parent-container)
- [OdspDocumentServiceFactory no longer requires a logger]
(#OdspDocumentServiceFactory-no-longer-requires-a-logger)

### `App Id` removed as a parameter to OdspDocumentServiceFactory
`@microsoft/fluid-odsp-driver` no longer requires consumers to pass in an app id as an input. Consumers should simply remove this parameter from the OdspDocumentServiceFactory/OdspDocumentServiceFactoryWithCodeSplit constructor.

### ConsensusRegisterCollection now supports storing handles
ConsensusRegisterCollection will properly serialize/deserialize handles added as values.

### Summarizing errors on parent container
The parent container of the summarizing container will now raise "error" events related to summarization problems. These will be of type `ISummarizingError` and will have a description indicating either a problem creating the summarizing container, a problem generating a summary, or a nack or ack wait timeout from the server.

### OdspDocumentServiceFactory no longer requires a logger
The logger will be passed in on createDocumentService or createContainer, no need to pass in one on construction of OdspDocumentServiceFactory.
