# Changesets

This folder contains changesets, which are markdown files that hold two key bits of information: a
version type (following semver), and change information to be added to a changelog. You can find the full documentation
for it [in the changesets repository](https://github.com/changesets/changesets)

We have a list of common questions to get you started with changesets in this project in
[our wiki](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/wiki/Changesets-FAQ).
