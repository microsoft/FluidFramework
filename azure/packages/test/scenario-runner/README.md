# @fluid-experimental/azure-scenario-runner

## Azure Scenario Runner

This package provides a reference application that executes pre-set scenarios with the intent of measuring the Fluid Framework's performance and reliability. We primarily use this package as part of a pipeline scheduled to run periodically to measure, log, and report various performance and reliability metrics. These metrics can then be used to gauge an understanding of the expected behavior/performance of the Fluid Framework in these various scenarios, which can help define the SLA.

**IMPORTANT: This package is experimental.**
**Its APIs may change without notice.**

**Do not use in production scenarios.**

## Using Fluid Framework libraries

When taking a dependency on a Fluid Framework library's public APIs, we recommend using a `^` (caret) version range, such as `^1.3.4`.
While Fluid Framework libraries may use different ranges with interdependencies between other Fluid Framework libraries,
library consumers should always prefer `^`.

If using any of Fluid Framework's unstable APIs (for example, its `beta` APIs), we recommend using a more constrained version range, such as `~`.

## Installation

To get started, install the package by running the following command:

```bash
npm i @fluid-experimental/azure-scenario-runner
```

## API Documentation

API documentation for **@fluid-experimental/azure-scenario-runner** is available at <https://fluidframework.com/docs/apis/azure-scenario-runner>.

## Implemented Scenarios

### Azure Client

Tests creating an Azure Client

### Doc Creator

This scenario creates a bunch of empty Fluid documents and measures the time it takes to create theses documents.

### Doc Loader

This scenario loads a set of previously created docs multiple times and measures the time it takes to load these documents.

### Map Traffic

This scenario loads a previously created document and generates traffic on that document by setting key-values in a `SharedMap` from multiple clients.

### Nested Map

This scenario creates/loads a document and attempts to add many nested `SharedMap`s. Various configs control whether the nested maps are created before or after `container.attach()`, how many maps to create, and how long to wait between creating each map.

# Guides

## Running the perf tests locally

1. Set the `azure__fluid__relay__service__tenantId` environment variable to equal your Azure Fluid Relay (AFR) TenantID
2. Set the `azure__fluid__relay__service__tenantKey` environment variable to equal your AFR Tenant's Primary Key
3. Set the `azure__fluid__relay__service__function__url` environment variable to equal your AFR Service Function URL
4. Set the `azure__fluid__relay__service__endpoint` environment variable to equal the Alfred endpoint of your AFR tenant
5. (Optional) Set the `azure__fluid__relay__service__region` environment variable to equal the region of your AFR tenant (eg. `westus2`, `westus3`, `eastus`, `westeurope`)
6. Run the test with `npm run start`

## Configuring the test configuration

The test configuration file `testConfig_v1.yml` can be configured to modify the parameters of each scenario and the order they're run in.

## Adding New Scenarios

[TBD]

Scenario runner for AFR and Azure Local Service. This package can be used to create and execute various scenarios involving azure-client, IFluidContainer and a range of distributed data structures (DDSes), while collecting telemetry and validating state in the process. Scenarios are sourced via yaml config files.

You can add new scenarios by following existing patterns (see `MapTrafficRunner` or `DocLoaderRunner` for examples) and adding additional test configs to the `configs` directory. Then, run your scenario with the command: `npm run start:scenario ./configs/<config-name>.yml`.

## Minimum Client Requirements

These are the platform requirements for the current version of Fluid Framework Client Packages.
These requirements err on the side of being too strict since within a major version they can be relaxed over time, but not made stricter.
For Long Term Support (LTS) versions this can require supporting these platforms for several years.

It is likely that other configurations will work, but they are not supported: if they stop working, we do not consider that a bug.
If you would benefit from support for something not listed here, file an issue and the product team will evaluate your request.
When making such a request please include if the configuration already works (and thus the request is just that it becomes officially supported), or if changes are required to get it working.

### Supported Runtimes

-   NodeJs ^20.10.0 except that we will drop support for it [when NodeJs 20 loses its upstream support on 2026-04-30](https://github.com/nodejs/release#release-schedule), and will support a newer LTS version of NodeJS (22) at least 1 year before 20 is end-of-life. This same policy applies to NodeJS 22 when it is end of life (2027-04-30).
-   Modern browsers supporting the es2022 standard library: in response to asks we can add explicit support for using babel to polyfill to target specific standards or runtimes (meaning we can avoid/remove use of things that don't polyfill robustly, but otherwise target modern standards).

### Supported Tools

-   TypeScript 5.4:
    -   All [`strict`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig) options are supported.
    -   [`strictNullChecks`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig) is required.
    -   [Configuration options deprecated in 5.0](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/51909) are not supported.
    -   `exactOptionalPropertyTypes` is currently not fully supported.
        If used, narrowing members of Fluid Framework types types using `in`, `Reflect.has`, `Object.hasOwn` or `Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty` should be avoided as they may incorrectly exclude `undefined` from the possible values in some cases.
-   [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) 5
    -   We are not intending to be prescriptive about what bundler to use.
        Other bundlers which can handle ES Modules should work, but webpack is the only one we actively test.

### Module Resolution

[`Node16`, `NodeNext`, or `Bundler`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#moduleResolution) resolution should be used with TypeScript compilerOptions to follow the [Node.js v12+ ESM Resolution and Loading algorithm](https://nodejs.github.io/nodejs.dev/en/api/v20/esm/#resolution-and-loading-algorithm).
Node10 resolution is not supported as it does not support Fluid Framework's API structuring pattern that is used to distinguish stable APIs from those that are in development.

### Module Formats

-   ES Modules:
    ES Modules are the preferred way to consume our client packages (including in NodeJs) and consuming our client packages from ES Modules is fully supported.
-   CommonJs:
    Consuming our client packages as CommonJs is supported only in NodeJS and only for the cases listed below.
    This is done to accommodate some workflows without good ES Module support.
    If you have a workflow you would like included in this list, file an issue.
    Once this list of workflows motivating CommonJS support is empty, we may drop support for CommonJS one year after notice of the change is posted here.

    -   Testing with Jest (which lacks [stable ESM support](https://jestjs.io/docs/ecmascript-modules) due to [unstable APIs in NodeJs](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/37648))
