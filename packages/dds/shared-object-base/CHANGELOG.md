# @fluidframework/shared-object-base

## 2.0.0-rc.5.0.0

### Minor Changes

-   fluid-framework: Type Erase ISharedObjectKind ([#21081](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/pull/21081)) [78f228e370](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/78f228e37055bd4d9a8f02b3a1eefebf4da9c59c)

    A new type, `SharedObjectKind` is added as a type erased version of `ISharedObjectKind` and `DataObjectClass`.

    This type fills the role of both `ISharedObjectKind` and `DataObjectClass` in the `@public` "declarative API" exposed in the `fluid-framework` package.

    This allows several types referenced by `ISharedObjectKind` to be made `@alpha` as they should only need to be used by legacy code and users of the unstable/alpha/legacy "encapsulated API".

    Access to these now less public types should not be required for users of the `@public` "declarative API" exposed in the `fluid-framework` package, but can still be accessed for those who need them under the `/legacy` import paths.
    The full list of such types is:

    -   `SharedTree` as exported from `@fluidframwork/tree`: It is still exported as `@public` from `fluid-framework` as `SharedObjectKind`.
    -   `ISharedObjectKind`: See new `SharedObjectKind` type for use in `@public` APIs.
        `ISharedObject`
    -   `IChannel`
    -   `IChannelAttributes`
    -   `IChannelFactory`
    -   `IExperimentalIncrementalSummaryContext`
    -   `IGarbageCollectionData`
    -   `ISummaryStats`
    -   `ISummaryTreeWithStats`
    -   `ITelemetryContext`
    -   `IDeltaManagerErased`
    -   `IFluidDataStoreRuntimeEvents`
    -   `IFluidHandleContext`
    -   `IProvideFluidHandleContext`

    Removed APIs:

    -   `DataObjectClass`: Usages replaced with `SharedObjectKind`.
    -   `LoadableObjectClass`: Replaced with `SharedObjectKind`.
    -   `LoadableObjectClassRecord`: Replaced with `Record<string, SharedObjectKind>`.
    -

-   Update to TypeScript 5.4 ([#21214](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/pull/21214)) [0e6256c722](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/0e6256c722d8bf024f4325bf02547daeeb18bfa6)

    Update package implementations to use TypeScript 5.4.5.

-   fluid-framework: Remove several types from `@public` scope ([#21142](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/pull/21142)) [983e9f09f7](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/983e9f09f7b10fef9ffa1e9af86166f0ccda7e14)

    The following types have been moved from `@public` to `@alpha`:

    -   `IFluidSerializer`
    -   `ISharedObjectEvents`
    -   `IChannelServices`
    -   `IChannelStorageService`
    -   `IDeltaConnection`
    -   `IDeltaHandler`

    These should not be needed by users of the declarative API, which is what `@public` is targeting.

## 2.0.0-rc.4.0.0

### Minor Changes

-   Deprecated members of IFluidHandle are split off into new IFluidHandleInternal interface [96872186d0](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/96872186d0d0f245c1fece7d19b3743e501679b6)

    Split IFluidHandle into two interfaces, `IFluidHandle` and `IFluidHandleInternal`.
    Code depending on the previously deprecated members of IFluidHandle can access them by using `toFluidHandleInternal` from `@fluidframework/runtime-utils/legacy`.

    External implementation of the `IFluidHandle` interface are not supported: this change makes the typing better convey this using the `ErasedType` pattern.
    Any existing and previously working, and now broken, external implementations of `IFluidHandle` should still work at runtime, but will need some unsafe type casts to compile.
    Such handle implementation may break in the future and thus should be replaced with use of handles produced by the Fluid Framework client packages.

## 2.0.0-rc.3.0.0

### Major Changes

-   Packages now use package.json "exports" and require modern module resolution [97d68aa06b](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/97d68aa06bd5c022ecb026655814aea222a062ae)

    Fluid Framework packages have been updated to use the [package.json "exports"
    field](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v18.x/api/packages.html#exports) to define explicit entry points for both
    TypeScript types and implementation code.

    This means that using Fluid Framework packages require the following TypeScript settings in tsconfig.json:

    -   `"moduleResolution": "Node16"` with `"module": "Node16"`
    -   `"moduleResolution": "Bundler"` with `"module": "ESNext"`

    We recommend using Node16/Node16 unless absolutely necessary. That will produce transpiled JavaScript that is suitable
    for use with modern versions of Node.js _and_ Bundlers.
    [See the TypeScript documentation](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#moduleResolution) for more information
    regarding the module and moduleResolution options.

    **Node10 moduleResolution is not supported; it does not support Fluid Framework's API structuring pattern that is used
    to distinguish stable APIs from those that are in development.**

### Minor Changes

-   fluid-framework: Replace SharedObjectClass with new ISharedObjectKind type. [97d68aa06b](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/97d68aa06bd5c022ecb026655814aea222a062ae)

    The static objects used as SharedObjectClass now explicitly implement the new ISharedObjectKind type.
    SharedObjectClass has been removed as ISharedObjectKind now fills that role.
    LoadableObjectCtor has been inlined as it only had one use: an external user of it can replace it with `(new (...args: any[]) => T)`.

## 2.0.0-rc.2.0.0

### Minor Changes

-   fluid-framework: SharedObject classes are no longer exported as public ([#19717](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/issues/19717)) [ae1d0be26d](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/ae1d0be26d61453cff316b3f622a9f3647149167)

    `SharedObject` and `SharedObjectCore` are intended for authoring DDSes, and thus are only intended for use within the Fluid Framework client packages.
    They is no longer publicly exported: any users should fine their own solution or be upstreamed.
    `SharedObject` and `SharedObjectCore` are available for now as `@alpha` to make this migration less disrupting for any existing users.

## 2.0.0-rc.1.0.0

### Minor Changes

-   Updated server dependencies ([#19122](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/issues/19122)) [25366b4229](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/25366b422918cb43685c5f328b50450749592902)

    The following Fluid server dependencies have been updated to the latest version, 3.0.0. [See the full changelog.](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/releases/tag/server_v3.0.0)

    -   @fluidframework/gitresources
    -   @fluidframework/server-kafka-orderer
    -   @fluidframework/server-lambdas

    -   @fluidframework/server-services-telemetry
    -   @fluidframework/server-services-utils
    -   @fluidframework/server-test-utils
    -   tinylicious

-   Updated @fluidframework/protocol-definitions ([#19122](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/issues/19122)) [25366b4229](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/25366b422918cb43685c5f328b50450749592902)

    The @fluidframework/protocol-definitions dependency has been upgraded to v3.1.0. [See the full
    changelog.](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/blob/main/common/lib/protocol-definitions/CHANGELOG.md#310)

-   shared-object-base: SharedObject processGCDataCore now takes IFluidSerializer rather than SummarySerializer ([#18803](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/issues/18803)) [396b8e9738](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/396b8e9738156ff88b62424a0076f09fb5028a32)

    This change should be a no-op for consumers, and `SummarySerializer` and `IFluidSerializer` expose the same consumer facing APIs. This change just makes our APIs more consistent by only using interfaces, rather than a mix of interfaces and concrete implementations.

### Major Changes

-   Dependencies on @fluidframework/protocol-definitions package updated to 3.0.0 [871b3493dd](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/871b3493dd0d7ea3a89be64998ceb6cb9021a04e)

    This included the following changes from the protocol-definitions release:

    -   Updating signal interfaces for some planned improvements. The intention is split the interface between signals
        submitted by clients to the server and the resulting signals sent from the server to clients.
        -   A new optional type member is available on the ISignalMessage interface and a new ISentSignalMessage interface has
            been added, which will be the typing for signals sent from the client to the server. Both extend a new
            ISignalMessageBase interface that contains common members.
    -   The @fluidframework/common-definitions package dependency has been updated to version 1.0.0.

-   Server upgrade: dependencies on Fluid server packages updated to 2.0.1 [871b3493dd](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/871b3493dd0d7ea3a89be64998ceb6cb9021a04e)

### Major Changes

-   Upgraded typescript transpilation target to ES2020 [8abce8cdb4](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/8abce8cdb4e2832fb6405fb44e393bef03d5648a)

    Upgraded typescript transpilation target to ES2020. This is done in order to decrease the bundle sizes of Fluid Framework packages. This has provided size improvements across the board for ex. Loader, Driver, Runtime etc. Reduced bundle sizes helps to load lesser code in apps and hence also helps to improve the perf.If any app wants to target any older versions of browsers with which this target version is not compatible, then they can use packages like babel to transpile to a older target.
