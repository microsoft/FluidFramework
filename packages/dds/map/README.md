## Using Fluid Framework libraries

For a dependency on a Fluid Framework library's public APIs, we recommend a `^` (caret) version range.
For example, use `^1.3.4`.

For a dependency on an unstable API, such as a `beta` API, we recommend a more restrictive version range.
For example, use a `~` version range.

## Installation

Run this command to install the package:

```bash
npm i @fluidframework/map
```

## Importing from this package

This package uses [package.json exports](https://nodejs.org/api/packages.html#exports) to separate APIs by support level.
For information about the support guarantees, read [API Support Levels](https://fluidframework.com/docs/build/releases-and-apitags/#api-support-levels).

Import the `public` ([Semantic Versioning (SemVer)](https://semver.org/)) APIs from `@fluidframework/map`.

Import the `legacy` APIs from `@fluidframework/map/legacy`.

## API Documentation

## SharedMap

The SharedMap distributed data structure can be used to store key-value pairs. It provides the same API for setting and
retrieving values that JavaScript developers are accustomed to with the
[Map](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map) built-in object.

### Creation

To create a `SharedMap`, call the static create method:

```typescript
const myMap = SharedMap.create(this.runtime, id);
```

### Usage

Unlike the JavaScript `Map`, a `SharedMap`'s keys must be strings. The value must only be plain JS objects or handles (e.g. to another DDS or Fluid objects).

In collaborative scenarios, the value is settled with a policy of _last write wins_.

### Eventing

`SharedMap` is an `EventEmitter`, and will emit events when other clients make modifications. You should register for these events and respond appropriately as the data is modified. `valueChanged` will be emitted in response to a `set` or `delete`, and provide the key and previous value that was stored at that key. `clear` will be emitted in response to a `clear`.

## SharedDirectory and IDirectory

A `SharedDirectory` is a map-like DDS that additionally supports storing key/value pairs within a tree of subdirectories. This subdirectory tree can be used to give hierarchical structure to stored key/value pairs rather than storing them on a flat map. Both the `SharedDirectory` and any subdirectories are `IDirectories`.

### Creation

To create a `SharedDirectory`, call the static create method:

```typescript
const myDirectory = SharedDirectory.create(this.runtime, id);
```

### Usage

The map operations on an `IDirectory` refer to the key/value pairs stored in that `IDirectory`, and function just like `SharedMap` including the same extra functionality and restrictions on keys and values. To operate on the subdirectory structure, use the corresponding subdirectory methods.

#### `getWorkingDirectory()`

To "navigate" the subdirectory structure, `IDirectory` provides a `getWorkingDirectory` method which takes a relative path and returns the `IDirectory` located at that path if it exists.

#### Eventing

`valueChanged` events additionally provide the absolute path to the subdirectory storing the value that changed.

`dispose` events are fired on sub directory which is deleted. Any access to this sub directory will throw an error once it is disposed.

## Minimum Client Requirements

Fluid Framework client libraries support the platforms in this document.
These requirements are intentionally restrictive.
Within a major version series, we can relax these requirements, but we cannot make them stricter.
For a Long Term Support (LTS) version, we might need to support these platforms for several years.

Other configurations can work, but Fluid Framework does not support them.
If an unsupported configuration stops working, we do not classify this as a bug.
To request support for a configuration that is not listed, file an issue.
The product team will evaluate your request.
In the issue, specify the current status of the configuration:

-   The configuration works but needs official support.
-   The configuration does not work and requires changes.

### Supported Runtimes

-   Fluid Framework supports Node.js versions 22 and 24 while they receive [upstream support](https://nodejs.org/en/about/previous-releases).
    -   Fluid Framework will stop support for version 22 [when upstream support ends on 2027-04-30](https://github.com/nodejs/release#release-schedule).
    -   Fluid Framework does not support Node.js with the `--no-experimental-fetch` flag.
-   Fluid Framework supports modern browsers that support the ES2022 standard library.

### Supported Tools

-   [TypeScript 6.0](https://typescriptdocs.com/release-notes/TypeScript%206.0):
    -   Fluid Framework supports all [`strict`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig) options.
    -   Set the build targets (`lib`, `target`) to `ES2022` or later.
    -   Enable [`strictNullChecks`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig).
    -   Fluid Framework does not support [configuration options deprecated in TypeScript 6.0](https://typescriptdocs.com/release-notes/TypeScript%206.0#breaking-changes-and-deprecations-in-typescript-6-0).
    -   Fluid Framework does not fully support `exactOptionalPropertyTypes`.
        If you enable this option, do not use `in`, `Reflect.has`, `Object.hasOwn`, or `Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty` to narrow members of Fluid Framework types.
        These methods can incorrectly exclude `undefined` from the possible values.
-   [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) 5
    -   We do not require a specific bundler.
        Other bundlers that handle ES Modules can work, but we actively test only webpack.

### Module Resolution

In TypeScript `compilerOptions`, use [`Node16`, `Node20`, `NodeNext`, or `Bundler`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#moduleResolution) module resolution.
These settings follow the [Node.js v12+ ESM Resolution and Loading algorithm](https://nodejs.github.io/nodejs.dev/en/api/v20/esm/#resolution-and-loading-algorithm).

Do not use `Node10` module resolution.

### Module Formats

-   ES Modules:
    Use ES Modules to consume Fluid Framework client packages, including in Node.js.
-   CommonJS:
    Fluid Framework does not officially support CommonJS in version 3.0 or later.
