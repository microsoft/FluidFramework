 *
 * Note that the in-memory equivalent of ISerializableValue is ILocalValue (similarly holding a type, but with

 *
 * If type is Plain, it must be a plain JS object that can survive a JSON.stringify/parse.  E.g. a URL object will
 * just get stringified to a URL string and not rehydrate as a URL object on the other side. It may contain members
 * that are ISerializedHandle (the serialized form of a handle).
 *
 * If type is a value type then it must be amongst the types registered via registerValueType or we won't know how
 * to serialize/deserialize it (we rely on its factory via .load() and .store()).  Its value will be type-dependent.
 * If type is Shared, then the in-memory value will just be a reference to the SharedObject.  Its value will be a
 * channel ID.
