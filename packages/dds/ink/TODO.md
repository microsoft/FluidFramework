# Next steps for Ink/Canvases

Ink is an in-progress data structure with the purpose of facilitating collaborative inking.  There is a set of anticipated work to be done still, including breaking changes across Ink, client-ui-lib/OverlayCanvas, and the Canvas example.  Please do try it out and let us know what you think, but also be prepared for the following incoming changes:

## Coordinate bundling
- Enable bundled coordinate updates rather than one per op

## Canvas consolidation
- Replace client-ui-lib's OverlayCanvas with ink's InkCanvas, or remove it.
- Consider splitting the new InkCanvas control into input/output, to enable reuse of input handling across multiple renderers.

## Wet ink and ink drying
- Distinguish wet/dry ink in the data model
- Add an op for drying a stroke
- Enable wet/dry ink on OverlayCanvas/canvas

## Atomic stroke rendering
- Enable atomic stroke rendering on the canvases, allowing transparency in ink color (requires wet ink for rendering performance)
