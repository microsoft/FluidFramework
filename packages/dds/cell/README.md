# @fluidframework/cell

The `SharedCell` Distributed Data Structure (DDS) stores a single, shared value that can be edited or deleted.

This package is primarily intended as a minimal example of how distributed data structures work.
For real-world scenarios, we recommend DDSs like [SharedTree](https://fluidframework.com./docs/data-structures/tree/) or [SharedMap](https://fluidframework.com./docs/data-structures/map/).

## Using Fluid Framework libraries

When taking a dependency on a Fluid Framework library, we recommend using a `^` (caret) version range, such as `^1.3.4`.
While Fluid Framework libraries may use different ranges with interdependencies between other Fluid Framework libraries,
library consumers should always prefer `^`.

## Installation

To get started, install the package by running the following command:

```bash
npm i @fluidframework/cell
```
