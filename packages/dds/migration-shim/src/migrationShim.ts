 * @remarks
 *
 * This MigrationShim is responsible for submitting a migration op, processing the migrate op, swapping from the old
 * tree to the new tree, loading an old tree snapshot and creating an old tree.
 *
 * The MigrationShim expects to always load from a legacy SharedTree snapshot, though by the time it catches up in
 * processing all ops, it may find that the migration has already occurred.  After migration occurs, it modifies its
 * attributes to point at the SharedTreeShimFactory.  This will cause future clients to load with a SharedTreeShim and
 * the new SharedTree snapshot instead after the next summarization.
