# @fluid-experimental/signal-manager

The `signal-manager` package provides tools to assist common scenarios around working with signals.  It exports the `SignalManager` data object that exposes signaling functionality without needing to create a custom data object.  It also provides a lighter weight `Signaler` class that may be used within a custom data object.

This package is marked as experimental and currently under development.
