/**
 * A distributed data structure that tracks queues of clients that want to exclusively run a task.
 *
 * @example Creation
 *
 * To create a {@link TaskManager}, call the static create method:
 *
 * ```typescript
 * const taskManager = TaskManager.create(this.runtime, id);
 * ```
 *
 * @example Usage
 *
 * To volunteer for a task, use the {@link ITaskManager.volunteerForTask} method.
 * This returns a Promise that will resolve once the client has acquired exclusive rights to run the task,
 * or reject if the client is removed from the queue without acquiring the rights.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * taskManager.volunteerForTask("NameOfTask")
 *     .then(() => { doTheTask(); })
 *     .catch((err) => { console.error(err); });
 * ```
 *
 * Alternatively, you can indefinitely volunteer for a task with the synchronous {@link ITaskManager.subscribeToTask}
 * method. This method does not return a value, therefore you need to rely on eventing to know when you have acquired
 * the rights to run the task (see below).
 *
 * ```typescript
 * taskManager.subscribeToTask("NameOfTask");
 * ```
 *
 * To check if the local client is currently subscribed to a task, use the {@link ITaskManager.subscribed} method.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * if (taskManager.subscribed("NameOfTask")) {
 *     console.log("This client is currently subscribed to the task.");
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * To release the rights to the task, use the {@link ITaskManager.abandon} method.
 * The next client in the queue will then get the rights to run the task.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * taskManager.abandon("NameOfTask");
 * ```
 *
 * To inspect your state in the queue, you can use the {@link ITaskManager.queued} and {@link ITaskManager.assigned}
 * methods.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * if (taskManager.queued("NameOfTask")) {
 *     console.log("This client is somewhere in the queue, potentially even having the task assignment.");
 * }
 *
 * if (taskManager.assigned("NameOfTask")) {
 *     console.log("This client currently has the rights to run the task");
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * To signal to other connected clients that a task is completed, use the {@link ITaskManager.complete} method.
 * This will release all clients from the queue and emit the "completed" event.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * taskManager.complete("NameOfTask");
 * ```
 *
 * @example Eventing
 *
 * `ITaskManager` will emit events when a task is assigned to the client, when the task assignment is lost,
 * and when a task was completed by another client.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * taskManager.on("assigned", (taskId: string) => {
 *     console.log(`Client was assigned task: ${taskId}`);
 * });
 *
 * taskManager.on("lost", (taskId: string) => {
 *     console.log(`Client released task: ${taskId}`);
 * });
 *
 * taskManager.on("completed", (taskId: string) => {
 *     console.log(`Another client completed task: ${taskId}`);
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * These can be useful if the logic to volunteer for a task is separated from the logic to perform the task, such as
 * when using {@link ITaskManager.subscribeToTask}.
 *
 * See {@link ITaskManagerEvents} for more details.
