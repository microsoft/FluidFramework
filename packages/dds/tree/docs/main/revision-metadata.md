# Revision Metadata

Rebase operations need metadata to provided by the caller (e.g., the high-level rebasing algorithm) about the overall branching structure that the rebase takes place in.
For example, if commit `B` from a branch `[A, B]` is being rebased over some commit `X` as part of rebasing `[A, B]` over `X`,
then that rebase operation needs to be informed about `A`'s relative position in the commit graph w.r.t. to `X`.

This page aims to explain why this is the case and precisely define the characteristics of this scheme.
While the scheme for revision metadata is not specific to sequence fields, sequence fields are currently the only motivator for it.
This document therefore focuses on them.

## Commits and Cell IDs

The idea of cells is introduced in [cell-model-of-collaborative-editing.md](cell-model-of-collaborative-editing.md).
The core idea is that, in addition to requiring a way to refer to positions that nodes occupy
(which we accomplish using integer indices for nodes in a given sequence, at a given point in the commit graph)
we need a way to refer to the positions that nodes will occupy or have occupied in the past.
We call these "cells".

We accomplish this by assigning a unique ID to each such cell.
Each cell ID is associated with the commit that introduced it,
which makes it easy to check if a given commit introduced a given cell.

Being able to refer to empty cells makes it possible for commits to convey position information relative to such cells.
For example, if some commit `A` inserts content before some empty cell `c`
while some other commit `X` concurrently inserts content after that same cell `c`,
then we know that, the content inserted by `A` should come before the content inserted by commit `X`
no matter the order in which the commits `A` and `X` end up sequenced in the commit history.
If these commits had not been able to refer to `c`, then there would not have been a way to guarantee the relative ordering of their inserted contents.

There are two cases where a commit introduces new cell ID:

1. Inserting a new node in a sequence introduces a cell ID to refer to the cell that will hold the node.
   In the input context of the commit, the cell is empty.
   In the output context of the commit the cell is populated with the inserted node.
2. Moving or removing a node from a sequence introduces a cell ID to refer to the cell that held the node.
   In the input context of the commit, the cell is populated with the node.
   In the output context of the commit, the cell is empty.

Commits can also refer to a cell using an ID that was introduced in a prior commit.
This occurs in two cases:

1. An inverse commit (whether a rollback or revert) refers to cells that the commit it is the inverse of referred to and uses the same IDs to do so.
   For example, if commit `A` removes a node and therefore introduces cell ID `Id1` to refer to the cell it empties,
   then the inverse of `A` will restore that node to the same cell, referring to that cell using `Id1`.

2. Rebasing a commit `A` over a commit `X` leads to a commit `A'` that refers to all that either `A` or `X` referred to.
   For example, if `A` inserts a node next to a node `n`, and `X` removes `n` thereby introducing cell ID `Id1` to refer to the cell where `n` used to be,
   then `A'` will carry a mark that uses `Id1` in order to describe the location of the cell that used to contain `n`.

One can infer from the above that for a given commit `C`...
* `C` refers to all cells introduced in `C`.
* `C` refers to all cells introduced in ancestors of `C` up to some ancestor.

The commits that introduce cells that `C` refers to therefore from a contiguous subsequence always including and ending in `C`.

In commit graph diagrams, we can represent this contiguous subsequence visually with a segment that extends from `C` backwards under all the commits that introduced cells that `C` refers to:

![C refers to cells in C](../.attachments/revision-metadata/C-knows-of-C.png)<br />
_`C` refers to all cells introduced in `C` and all its ancestors up to and excluding `B`._


![C refers to cells in A, B and C](../.attachments/revision-metadata/C-knows-of-ABC.png)<br />
_`C` refers to all cells introduced in `C` and all its ancestors up to and including `A`._


## Cell Ordering From Commit Ordering

While cells help specify the relative order of content in sequences,
there are some situation where the information contained in commits only specify a partial order.
The rebasing system is responsible for picking a total ordering that is consistent across peers.
It does this based on the relative sequencing order of the commits in the commit graph.
This happens in two cases:

1. When cells are being introduced in the same gap by concurrent commits.<br />
   ![X and A are concurrent](../.attachments/revision-metadata/XvsA.png)<br />
   _`X` and `A` are concurrent so the relative order of cells they introduced in the same gap is unspecified.<br />
   The colors have no intrinsic meaning. Their purpose is to depict which commit refers to cell introduced by which commit._

2. When a commit `C` introduces cells in a gap where one of its ancestors (commit `A`) introduced cells that are empty in the input context of `C`,
   and `C` does not include references to the cells introduced by `A`.<br />
   ![A is an ancestor of C](../.attachments/revision-metadata/C-knows-of-C.png)<br />
   _`C` does not refer to cells introduced by its ancestor `A`,
   so the relative order of cells `C` and `A` introduce in the same gap is unspecified._

In both of this cases we order the cells introduced by the later commit left of the cells introduced by the earlier commit.
This leads to a system where,
in order to determine the relative order of two cells,
we sometimes need to know the relative order of the two commits that introduced the cells.

In the remainder of this section, we consider the cell-ordering scenarios that compose and rebase operation face.

### Compose

When composing `A â—‹ B`, we know the following about the commit graph:

* `A` comes before `B` in sequencing order.
* `A` and `B` are not concurrent.
* There are no commits between `A` and `B` in sequencing order.
* There may be commits before `A` that either `A` and/or `B` can refer to.

We can represent this situation with the following commit graph:<br />
![P1->P2->A->B](../.attachments/revision-metadata/compose-a-b.png)<br />
`P1` and `P2` are  prior commits (which is not being composed).
They are included here because `A` and/or `B` may refer to cells that `P1` and `P2` introduce.
While there may be any number of such prior commits that introduced cells that `A` and/or `B` may refer to,
using two commits is sufficient to fully consider the relevant cases.

For each pair of cells (`ca`, `cb`) referred to by `A` and `B` respectively,
we need to be able to determine the relative ordering of `ca` and `cb`.
The space of possible comparisons looks like this:
```
                        +---------------------+
                        |   cb introduced by  |
                        +----+----+-----+-----+
                        | P1 | P2 |  A  |  B  |
+------------------+----+----+----+-----+-----+
|                  | P1 |    |    |     |     |
|                  +----+----+----+-----+-----+
| ca introduced by | P2 |    |    |     |     |
|                  +----+----+----+-----+-----+
|                  | A  |    |    |     |     |
+------------------+----+----+----+-----+-----+
```

There are multiple ways the implementation of compose could be structured to deal with these cases.
For the purposes of this document, we are not interested in coming up with or describing a specific implementation.
We instead consider what relevant information is available to the space of all possible implementations.

#### Pairs of Cells Introduced by The Same Commit

If `ca` and `cb` both refer to cells introduced by the same commit
(whether or not they refer to the exact same cell), then,
because commits always contain ordered references to either none or all cells introduced in a commit,
`A` or `B` must both contain ordered references both `ca` and `cb`.
This ordering can be looked up in either commit.
This takes care of the following cases:
```
                        +---------------------+
                        |   cb introduced by  |
                        +----+----+-----+-----+
                        | P1 | P2 |  A  |  B  |
+------------------+----+----+----+-----+-----+
|                  | P1 | ## |    |     |     |
|                  +----+----+----+-----+-----+
| ca introduced by | P2 |    | ## |     |     |
|                  +----+----+----+-----+-----+
|                  | A  |    |    | ### |     |
+------------------+----+----+----+-----+-----+
```

#### Pairs of Cells Introduced by Different Input Commits

Given a commit `C` and a reference to a cell `c`,
we can use the ID used to reference `c` to check if `c` was introduced by `C`.
The compose function can use this to detect cases where `ca` refers to `A` and `cb` refers to `B`.
These cases are trivially resolvable because we know `A` comes before `B` in sequencing order.
This takes care of the following cases:
```
                        +---------------------+
                        |   cb introduced by  |
                        +----+----+-----+-----+
                        | P1 | P2 |  A  |  B  |
+------------------+----+----+----+-----+-----+
|                  | P1 |    |    |     |     |
|                  +----+----+----+-----+-----+
| ca introduced by | P2 |    |    |     |     |
|                  +----+----+----+-----+-----+
|                  | A  |    |    |     | ### |
+------------------+----+----+----+-----+-----+
```

#### Pairs of Cells With One Cell Introduced by Either Input Commit

Being able to detect whether `ca` and/or `cb` were introduced by `A` or `B` also allows us to handle cases where only one of `ca` and `cb` refers to a cell introduced by `A` or `B`.
This is because any commit other than `A` and `B` that introduced cells that `A` or `B` might refer to must be an ancestor of `A` and `B`,
thus making the corresponding cell older.
This takes care of the following cases:
```
                        +---------------------+
                        |   cb introduced by  |
                        +----+----+-----+-----+
                        | P1 | P2 |  A  |  B  |
+------------------+----+----+----+-----+-----+
|                  | P1 |    |    | ### | ### |
|                  +----+----+----+-----+-----+
| ca introduced by | P2 |    |    | ### | ### |
|                  +----+----+----+-----+-----+
|                  | A  | ## | ## |     |     |
+------------------+----+----+----+-----+-----+
```

#### Pairs of Cells Both Referred to by Either Commit

If `A` refers to both `ca` and `cb`, then the relative order of `ca` and `cb` can be looked up in `A`.
Similarly, if `B` refers to both `ca` and `cb`, then the relative order of `ca` and `cb` can be looked up in `B`.

This insight requires taking into consideration how the set of commits that have introduced cells that `A` refers to relates to the set of commits that have introduced cells that `B` refers to.
Specifically, it requires taking into consideration where these sets intersect.

As an example, consider the following scenario:<br />
![](../.attachments/revision-metadata/compose-a-ref-p1-b-ref-p2.png)<br />
_`A` refers to cells introduced by `P1`, `P2`, and `A`.
`B` refers to cells introduced by `P2`, `A`, and `B`._

Because `A` and `B` both refer to cells introduced by `P2` and `A`,
no matter which commit introduced the cell that `ca` refers to,
any time `cb` refers to a cell introduced by `P2` or by `A`,
the relative ordering of `ca` and `cb` can be found in `A`.
This allows us to handle the following cases:
```
                        +----------------+
                        |cb introduced by|
                        +----+-----+-----+
                        | P2 |  A  |  B  |
+------------------+----+----+-----+-----+
|                  | P1 | ## | ### |     |
|                  +----+----+-----+-----+
| ca introduced by | P2 | ## | ### |     |
|                  +----+----+-----+-----+
|                  | A  | ## | ### |     |
+------------------+----+----+-----+-----+
```

Similarly, no matter which commit introduced the cell that `cb` refers to,
any time `ca` refers to a cell introduced by `P2` or by `A`,
the relative ordering of `ca` and `cb` can be found in `B`.
This allows us to handle the following cases:
```
                        +----------------+
                        |cb introduced by|
                        +----+-----+-----+
                        | P2 |  A  |  B  |
+------------------+----+----+-----+-----+
|                  | P1 |    |     |     |
|                  +----+----+-----+-----+
| ca introduced by | P2 | ## | ### | ### |
|                  +----+----+-----+-----+
|                  | A  | ## | ### | ### |
+------------------+----+----+-----+-----+
```

While this is only applicable to that scenario,
and different scenarios would yield different ordering capabilities using this approach,
we can intuit that this approach can at least be leveraged whenever the inclusion in one of the input commits of references to cells introduced by some commit entail the include of references cells introduced by other commits.
This is the case here because the inclusion of references to cells introduced by `P2` entail the inclusion of references introduced by `P1`,
and similarly, for `P1` and `A`.
This means that this approach can tackle the following cases:
```
                        +---------------------+
                        |   cb introduced by  |
                        +----+----+-----+-----+
                        | P1 | P2 |  A  |  B  |
+------------------+----+----+----+-----+-----+
|                  | P1 | ## | ## | ### |     |
|                  +----+----+----+-----+-----+
| ca introduced by | P2 | ## | ## | ### |     |
|                  +----+----+----+-----+-----+
|                  | A  | ## | ## | ### |     |
+------------------+----+----+----+-----+-----+
```

Note that we don't need to know which scenario we find ourselves in to benefit from this approach.
We can just check whether `A` contains a reference to `cb` or `B` contains a reference to `ca` and leverage whichever is the case.

#### Pairs of Cell Where `ca` Is Unknown to `B`

Whenever `ca` refers to a cell that `B` has no reference to,
we can be sure that `ca` was introduced by a commit that is older than whichever one introduced the cell that `cb` refers to.

To see this is true, consider all the possible scenarios where `A` could make a reference to a cell that `B` does not refer to:<br />
![](../.attachments/revision-metadata/compose-b-no-ref-to-ca.png)

In all such scenarios, cells known to `A` and unknown to `B` are introduced in commits that have a blue underline but no red underline,
while `cb` must be introduced by a commit that has a red underline (whether or not it also has blue underline).
One can see from the diagrams that the former always precedes the latter in sequencing order.

#### Putting it All Together

By looking at which cases each of these approaches can handle,
we can see that they are enough to address any cell ordering scenario in compositions when taken together.
This shows how implementations of compose need not rely on extra metadata in order to correctly order cells.

### Rebase

When rebasing `B â†· X`, we know the following about the commit graph:

* `X` and `B` are concurrent and have the same ancestry.
* `X` comes before `B` in sequencing order.

Note that it does _not_ follow from the above that `B` comes directly after `X` in sequencing order.
In the simplest case, `B` does comes directly after `X`,
which amounts to the following graph:<br />
![](../.attachments/revision-metadata/rebase-b-over-x.png)<br />
with the goal to produce `B'`:<br />
![](../.attachments/revision-metadata/rebase-to-bprime.png)<br />

In the more general case, there can be any number of commits between `P` and `B`,
which amounts to the following graph:<br />
![](../.attachments/revision-metadata/rebase-ab-over-x.png)<br />
with the goal to produce rebased versions of each before `B'`:<br />
![](../.attachments/revision-metadata/rebase-to-abprime.png)<br />

When confronted to this general case,
we first rebase `B` over the inverses of all the commits between `P` and `B`.
This produces to a commit `B2` that is akin to what `B` would have been if `P` were its direct ancestor:<br />
![](../.attachments/revision-metadata/rebase-b2.png)

It is this `B2` commit that is passed to the rebase function when performing `B â†· X`.
The graph of relevant commits in the general case therefore looks like this:<br />
![](../.attachments/revision-metadata/rebase-b2-over-x.png)

In the remainder of this section, we use `B` to refer to all variants of `B`,
and `B2` when statements more specifically apply to that particular variant of `B`.

For each pair of cells (`cb`, `cx`) referred to by `B2` and `X` respectively,
we need to be able to determine the relative ordering of `cb` and `cx`.
The space of possible comparisons looks like this:
```
                        +---------------------+
                        |  cb introduced by   |
                        +----+----+-----+-----+
                        | P1 | P2 |  A  |  B  |
+------------------+----+----+----+-----+-----+
|                  | P1 |    |    |     |     |
|                  +----+----+----+-----+-----+
| cx introduced by | P2 |    |    |     |     |
|                  +----+----+----+-----+-----+
|                  | X  |    |    |     |     |
+------------------+----+----+----+-----+-----+
```

As for compose, we consider what relevant information is available to the space of all possible implementations.
We gloss over the explanation when it is the same as it was for compose.

#### Pairs of Cells Introduced by The Same Commit

As for compose, this takes care of the following cases:
```
                        +---------------------+
                        |  cb introduced by   |
                        +----+----+-----+-----+
                        | P1 | P2 |  A  |  B  |
+------------------+----+----+----+-----+-----+
|                  | P1 | ## |    |     |     |
|                  +----+----+----+-----+-----+
| cx introduced by | P2 |    | ## |     |     |
|                  +----+----+----+-----+-----+
|                  | X  |    |    |     |     |
+------------------+----+----+----+-----+-----+
```

#### Pairs of Cells Introduced by Different Input Commits

As for compose, this takes care of the following cases:
```
                        +---------------------+
                        |  cb introduced by   |
                        +----+----+-----+-----+
                        | P1 | P2 |  A  |  B  |
+------------------+----+----+----+-----+-----+
|                  | P1 |    |    |     |     |
|                  +----+----+----+-----+-----+
| cx introduced by | P2 |    |    |     |     |
|                  +----+----+----+-----+-----+
|                  | X  |    |    |     | ### |
+------------------+----+----+----+-----+-----+
```

#### Pairs of Cells With One Cell Introduced by Either Input Commit

If `cb` refers to a cell introduced by `B`,
and `cx` does not refer to a cell introduced by `X`,
then we know that `cx` is older that `cb`.
This takes care of the following cases:
```
                        +---------------------+
                        |  cb introduced by   |
                        +----+----+-----+-----+
                        | P1 | P2 |  A  |  B  |
+------------------+----+----+----+-----+-----+
|                  | P1 |    |    |     | ### |
|                  +----+----+----+-----+-----+
| cx introduced by | P2 |    |    |     | ### |
|                  +----+----+----+-----+-----+
|                  | X  |    |    |     |     |
+------------------+----+----+----+-----+-----+
```

Note that we cannot handle cases where `cx` refers to a cell introduced by `X` and `cb` not not refer to a cell introduced by `B`
because `cb` might refer either to a cell introduced by `P1`, `P2` or `A`,
which have different implications for cell ordering.

#### Pairs of Cells Both Referred to by Either Commit

This works the same as in compose.


Its helpful to visualize the possible scenarios and group them as follows:

1. First group: `B2` only refer to cells introduced later than the cells referred to by `X` were introduced:<br />
![](../.attachments/revision-metadata/rebase-b2-over-x-later1.png)<br />
_`X` can refer to cells introduced in `X`.
`B2` can refer to cells introduced in `A` or `B`._<br />
<br />
![](../.attachments/revision-metadata/rebase-b2-over-x-later2.png)<br />
_`X` can refer to cells introduced in `P` or `X`.
`B2` can refer to cells introduced in `A` or `B`._<br />
<br />
1. Second group: `B2` only refers to cells introduced no earlier than the cells referred to by `X` were introduced:<br />
![](../.attachments/revision-metadata/rebase-b2-over-x-as-early.png)<br />
_`X` can refer to cells introduced in `P` or `X`.
`B2` can refer to cells introduced in `P`, `A` or `B`._<br />
<br />
1. Third group: `B2` refers to cells introduced both earlier and later than the cells referred to by `X` were introduced:<br />
![](../.attachments/revision-metadata/rebase-b2-over-x-earlier.png)<br />
_`X` can refer to cells introduced in `X`.
`B2` can refer to cells introduced in `P`, `A` or `B`._<br />

In the first group of scenarios,
we can order the two cells by relying on the fact that commits `P` and `X` both come before `A` and `B` in sequencing order.

The second group of scenarios is similar to the first,
with the added possibly that both `cb` and `cx` refer to a cell introduced by `P`.
When that's the case, both `X` and `B2` will include references to both `cb` and `cx`,
so they fully define the correct ordering.

In the third group of scenarios,
`cx` must be referring to a cell introduced `X` while `ca` may be referring to a cell introduced by either `P`, `A`, or `B`.
Given a cell ID and a commit, we can check if the cells corresponding to the ID was introduced in the commit.
This enables the rebase implementation to check whether `ca` corresponds to a cell that was introduced in `B`.
If it does, then `cb` was introduced by a later commit than `cx`.
If it does not, then we need outside knowledge to differentiate cells that refer to ancestors of `X` such as `P`,
from cells that refer commits that are sequenced between `X` and `B` such as `A`.
This knowledge is provided in the form of metadata that can, for any cell reference,
determine whether it refers to a commit on the branch being rebased (`A` or `B` in our example).

The implementation of rebase doesn't know which group of scenarios it's dealing with on a case by case basis,
but it can handle them all using the following steps:
1. Use the provided metadata to check if `cb` refers to a cell introduced in the branch being rebased.
   If so, then `cx` is older than `cb`.
2. If not, check if `X` also refers to `cb`,
   If so, then `X` carries information defining the ordering between `cx` and `cb`.
3. If not, then `cb` must be referring to a cell introduced by a common ancestor of `X` and `B`,
   while `cx` must be referring to a cell introduced by `X`.
   It's therefore safe to treat `cb` as older than `cx`.
