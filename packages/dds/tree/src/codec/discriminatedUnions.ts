/**
 * Applies a function to the content of a [discriminated union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tagged_union)
 * where the function to apply depends on which value from the union it holds.
 *
 * This uses a rather non-standard encoding of the union where it is an object with many differently named optional fields,
 * and which of the fields is populated determines the content type.
 * This union encoding has the advantage that schema validation (such as that implemented by TypeBox) can validate the data efficiently.
 * Other encodings--such as using an untagged union, then tagging the content types with a marker enum--require the schema validator to disambiguate the union members.
 * Most JSON validator implementations fail to recognize the marker enum determines which component of the discriminated union the data must be,
 * and end up checking against all candidate members of the union.
 *
 * @example
 *
 * The following union:
 * ```typescript
 * type Operation = Add | Subtract | Multiply | Divide;
 *
 * interface BinaryOperation {
 *     readonly left: number;
 *     readonly right: number;
 * }
 *
 * interface Add extends BinaryOperation {
 *     readonly type: "add";
 * }
 *
 * interface Subtract extends BinaryOperation {
 *     readonly type: "subtract";
 * }
 *
 * interface Multiply extends BinaryOperation {
 *     readonly type: "multiply";
 * }
 *
 * interface Divide extends BinaryOperation {
 *     readonly type: "divide";
 * }
 *
 * ```
 * Would be encoded using this strategy as:
 * ```typescript
 * interface EncodedBinaryOperation {
 *     readonly left: number;
 *     readonly right: number;
 * }
 *
 * interface EncodedOperation {
 *     add?: EncodedBinaryOperation;
 *     subtract?: EncodedBinaryOperation;
 *     multiply?: EncodedBinaryOperation;
 *     divide?: EncodedBinaryOperation;
 * }
 * ```
 * where only a single property of `EncodedOperation` is populated for a given encoded value.
