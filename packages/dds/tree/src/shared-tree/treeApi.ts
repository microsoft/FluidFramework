 * A requirement for a SharedTree transaction to succeed.

 * In general, when running a transaction a client can validate their tree state in whatever way they wish and decide to either proceed with the transaction or not.
 * However, they cannot know what the tree state will be when the transaction is _sequenced_.
 * There may have been any number of edits from other clients that get sequenced before the transaction is eventually sequenced.
 * Constraints provide a way to validate the tree state after the transaction has been sequenced and abort the transaction if the constraints are not met.
