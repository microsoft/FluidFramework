 * However, they cannot know what the tree state will be when the transaction is _sequenced_.
 * There may have been any number of edits from other clients that get sequenced before the transaction is eventually sequenced.
 * Constraints provide a way to validate the tree state after the transaction has been sequenced and abort the transaction if the constraints are not met.
 * All clients will validate the constraints of a transaction when it is sequenced, so all clients will agree on whether the transaction succeeds or not.
