/**
 * Takes in a tree and returns a view of it that conforms to the view schema.
 * The returned view referees to and can edit the provided one: it is not a fork of it.
 * Updates the stored schema in the tree to match the provided one if requested by config and compatible.
 *
 * If the tree is uninitialized (has no nodes or schema at all),
 * it is initialized to the config's initial tree and the provided schema are stored.
 * This is done even if `AllowedUpdateType.None`.
 *
 * @remarks
 * Doing initialization here, regardless of `AllowedUpdateType`, allows a small API that is hard to use incorrectly.
 * Other approach tend to have leave easy to make mistakes.
 * For example, having a separate initialization function means apps can forget to call it, making an app that can only open existing document,
 * or call it unconditionally leaving an app that can only create new documents.
 * It also would require the schema to be passed into to separate places and could cause issues if they didn't match.
 * Since the initialization function couldn't return a typed tree, the type checking wouldn't help catch that.
 * Also, if an app manages to create a document, but the initialization fails to get persisted, an app that only calls the initialization function
 * on the create code-path (for example how a schematized factory might do it),
 * would leave the document in an unusable state which could not be repaired when it is reopened (by the same or other clients).
 * Additionally, once out of schema content adapters are properly supported (with lazy document updates),
 * this initialization could become just another out of schema content adapter: at tha point it clearly belong here in schematize.
 *
 * TODO:
 * - Implement schema-aware API for return type.
 * - Support adapters for handling out of schema data.
 * - Handle initialization via an adapter.
 * - Support per adapter update policy.
 * - Support lazy schema updates.
 * - Improve discoverability of this by either integrating it into the factory or main SharedTree interfaces as a method.
