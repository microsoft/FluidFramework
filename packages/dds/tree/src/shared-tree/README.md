# Shared Tree

Provides a SharedObject for a tree.

This is formed by parameterizing SharedTreeCore with a good set of default features,
and ensuring this feature selection / configuration maintains compatibility with past and future versions of it.

# Status

Implementation is really just some notes/ideas, and nothing close to usable.
