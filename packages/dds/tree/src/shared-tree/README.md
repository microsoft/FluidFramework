# shared-tree

Provides a SharedObject for a tree.

This is formed by parameterizing SharedTreeCore with a good set of default features,
and ensuring this feature selection / configuration maintains compatibility with past and future versions of it.

# Status

Implementation is working, but the API layers to provide a nice experience (like a schema language, nice editing experience etc.) are very much a work in progress or outright missing in some cases.
