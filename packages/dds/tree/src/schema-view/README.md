# Schema-View

This folder extends "Schema-Stored", adding APIs for applications to view and interact with documents which use stored-schema.
Included are utilities for declaring schema with strong typescript types,
ways to detect and handle when a document's stored schema does not match the application's view schema,
libraries to help with schema evolution (changes to schema over time), and other related topics.

See [Stored and View Schema](../schema-stored/Stored&#32;and&#32;View&#32;Schema.md)
for more information about the current focus of this Schema library, and its overall design.
