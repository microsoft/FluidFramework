# Object Forest

Implementation of Forest using in place mutated javascript objects for tree nodes.

This is intended as a reference implementation, and thus is designed for minimal complexity, understandable design and clear correctness.

The performance should be reasonable when avoiding large numbers of nodes and long sequences, but is not the focus on this library.
