/**
 * This modules provides support for reading and writing a human readable (and editable) tree format.
 *
 * This implementation can handle all trees (so it does not need a fallback for any special cases),
 * and is not optimized.
 *
 * It's suitable for testing and debugging,
 * though it could also reasonably be used as a fallback for edge cases or for small trees.
 *
 * TODO: Use placeholders.
 * build / add operations should be able to include detached ranges instead of children directly.
 * summaries should be able to reference unloaded chunks instead of having children directly.
 * Leverage placeholders in the types below to accomplish this.
 * Determine how this relates to Cursor: should cursor be generic over placeholder values?
 * (Could use them for errors to allow non erroring cursors?)
 *
 * Note:
 * Currently a lot of Tree's codebase is using json for serialization.
 * Because putting json strings inside json works poorly (adds lots of escaping),
 * for now this library actually outputs and inputs the Json compatible type JsonableTree
 * rather than actual strings.
