 * This file provides an API for working with trees which is type safe even when schema is not known.

 * TODO:
 * This API should replace FlexTree as the default public API for tree access.
 * SchemaAware builds on this, adding editing and type safe APIs which can be accessed via SchematizeView.
 * Once this is finished, the unsafe FlexTree types can be removed (or converted to package internal documentation for the proxies).
