# schema-stored

This folder contains proof of concept level prototype code for a schema system for trees.
It is focused on how the schema system could work: mostly regarding what data could be stored where,
and what tree would need functionality wise with that data.
This implementation makes many choices for the sake of keeping this version minimal (ex: how values are handled)
that should be reealavualted as the design matures.

This folder is focused on "Stored Schema", which can be persisted in documents.
See [Stored and View Schema](./Stored&#32;and&#32;View&#32;Schema.md)
for more information about the current focus on this Schema library, and its overall design.
