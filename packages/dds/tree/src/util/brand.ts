 * Leaving `T` unconstrained here allows for better type inference when branding unions.
 * For example when assigning `brand(number)` a number to an optional branded number field,
 * constraining T to `BrandedType<unknown, string>` causes the inference to fail and requires explicitly providing the type parameter.
 * For example leaving T unconstrained instead allows the union of `BrandedType | undefined` to distribute over the conditional allowing the branding only the the union members which should be branded.
 * This does not permit branding an optional value into an optional field since non branded union members are still excluded from input to this function:
 * this is an intended restriction as it causes compile errors for misuse of this function (like using brand when the relevant type is not a branded type).
