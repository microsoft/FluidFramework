/**
 * Rebasing logic for a particular kind of change.
 *
 * This interface is used to provide rebase policy to `Rebaser`.
 *
 * The implementation must ensure TChangeset forms a [group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_(mathematics)) where:
 * - `compose([])` is the identity element.
 * - associativity is defined as `compose([...a, ...b])` is equal to
 * `compose([compose(a), compose(b)])` for all `a` and `b`.
 * - `inverse(a)` gives the inverse element of `a`.
 *
 * In these requirements the definition of equality is up to the implementer,
 * but it is required that any two changes which are considered equal:
 * - have the same impact when applied to any tree.
 * - can be substituted for each-other in all methods on this
 * interface and produce equal (by this same definition) results.
 *
 * For the sake of testability, implementations will likely want to have a concrete equality implementation.
 *
 * This API uses `compose` on arrays instead of an explicit identity element and associative binary operator
 * to allow the implementation more room for optimization,
 * but should otherwise be equivalent to the identity element and binary operator group approach.
 *
 * TODO:
 * Be more specific about the above requirements.
 * For example, would something that is close to forming a group but has precision issues
 * (ex: the floating point numbers and addition) be ok?
 * Would this cause decoherence (and thus be absolutely not ok),
 * or just minor semantic precision issues, which could be tolerated.
 * For now assume that such issues are not ok.

	 * - `rebase(compose([a, b]), c)` is equal to
	 * `compose([rebase(a, c), rebase(b, compose([inverse(a), c, rebase(a, c)])])`.
	 * - `rebase(a, compose([]))` is equal to `a`.
	 * - `rebase(compose([]), a)` is equal to `compose([])`.
