/**
 * Implementation notes:
 *
 * The visit is organized into four phases:
 * 1. a detach pass
 * 2. root transfers
 * 3. an attach pass
 * 4. root destructions
 *
 * The core idea is that before content can be attached, it must first exist and be in a detached field.
 * The detach pass is therefore responsible for making sure that all roots that needs to be attached during the
 * attach pass are detached.
 * In practice, this means the detach pass must:
 * - Create all subtrees that need to be created
 * - Detach all moved nodes
 *
 * In addition to that, the detach pass also detaches nodes that need removing, with the exception of nodes that get
 * replaced. The reason for this exception is that we need to be able to communicate replaces as atomic operations.
 * In order to do that, we need to wait until we are sure that the content to attach is available as a detached root.
 * Replaces are therefore handled during the attach pass.
 * Note that this could theoretically lead to a situation where, in the attach pass, one replace wants to attach
 * a node that has yet to be detached by another replace. This does not occur in practice because we do not support
 * editing operations that would lead to this situation.
 *
 * While the detach pass ensures that nodes to be attached are in a detached state, it does not guarantee that they
 * reside in the correct detach field. That is the responsibility of the root transfers phase.
 *
 * The attach phase carries out attaches and replaces.
 *
 * After the attach phase, roots destruction is carried out.
 * This needs to happen last to allow modifications to detached roots to be applied before they are destroyed.
 *
 * The details of the delta visit algorithm can impact how/when events are emitted by the objects that own the visitors.
 * For example, as of 2024-03-27, the subtreecChanged event of an AnchorNode is emitted when exiting a node during a
 * delta visit, and thus the two-pass nature of the algorithm means the event fires twice for any given change.
 * This two-pass nature also means that the event may fire at a time where no change is visible in the tree. E.g.,
 * if a node is being replaced, when the event fires during the detach pass no change in the tree has happened so the
 * listener won't see any; then when it fires during the attach pass, the change will be visible in the event listener.
 */

/**
 * Crawls the given `delta`, calling `visitor`'s callback for each change encountered.
 * Each successive call to the visitor callbacks assumes that the change described by earlier calls have been applied
 * to the document tree. For example, for a change that removes the first and third node of a field, the visitor calls
 * will first call detach with a range from indices 0 to 1 then call detach with a range from indices 1 to 2.
 *
 * @param delta - The delta to be crawled.
 * @param visitor - The object to notify of the changes encountered.
 * @param detachedFieldIndex - Index responsible for keeping track of the existing detached fields.
