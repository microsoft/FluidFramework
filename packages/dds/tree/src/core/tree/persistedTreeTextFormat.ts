/**
 * This module contains persisted types for a simple, human-readable tree format.
 *
 * It was forked from `treeTextFormat.ts` to more cleanly separate compatibility concerns: in the long-term,
 * treeTextFormat.ts is intended to be useful for debugging/test purposes but not for persisted document storage
 * due to its unoptimized nature.
 *
 * However, at the time of forking it was also used as a persisted format for several of SharedTree's indexes.
 * Using the same types for both scenarios is problematic since `treeTextFormat.ts` types are exposed to the
 * public API.
 * These types should be used instead for all persisted format concerns.
 *
 * Before SharedTree has committed to persisted format backwards-compatibility, changes to `treeTextFormat.ts`
 * should be accompanied by the same changes to this module.
 *
 * After that point, changes to `treeTextFormat.ts` will necessitate changes to codecs that deal with these types
 * (and types in this module should not be changed except in compliance with persisted type compatibility guidelines).
 *
 * Longer-term, usages of these types should likely be replaced with a more optimized format.
 * If that switch happens before SharedTree commits to back-compat, this persisted format file can be deleted.

/**
 * Json compatible map as object.
 * Keys are FieldKey strings.
 * Values are the content of the field specified by the key.
 *
 * WARNING:
 * Be very careful when using objects as maps:
 * Use `Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(fieldMap, key)` to safely check for keys.
 * Do NOT simply read the field and check for undefined as this will return values for `__proto__`
 * and various methods on Object.prototype, like `hasOwnProperty` and `toString`.
 * This exposes numerous bug possibilities, including prototype pollution.
 *
 * Due to the above issue, try to avoid this type (and the whole object as map pattern).
 * Only use this type when needed for json compatible maps,
 * but even in those cases consider lists of key value pairs for serialization and using `Map`
 * for runtime.
