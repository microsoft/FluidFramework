 *
 * A tree cursor is similar to a database cursor in that it allows for the efficient

 * tree cursors may be invalidated after any edit to the tree. For a cursor-like
 * structure that also remains valid across edits, see {@link AnchorNode}.

	 *
	 * @remarks
	 * Users of cursors frequently need to refer to places in trees, both fields and nodes.
	 * Approaches other than having the cursor have separate modes for these
	 * cases had issues even worse than having the two modes.
	 *
	 * For example, modeling fields as parent + key has issues when there is no
	 * parent, and doesn't provide a great way to do iteration over fields while
	 * also having a nice API and making it easy for the implementation to track
	 * state (like its current location inside a sequence tree of fields) while
	 * traversing without having to allocate some state management for that.
	 *
	 * Another approach, of using arrays of cursors for fields (like we currently
	 * do for inserting content) is very inefficient and better addressed by a
	 * dual mode cursor.
	 *
	 * Another approach, of using the first node in a field when referring to
	 * the field gets confusing since it's unclear if a given cursor means that
	 * node, or that node, and the ones after it, and in the second case, it's
	 * hard to restore the cursor back to the right state when returning. It also
	 * doesn't work for empty fields. Overall there just didn't seem to be a way
	 * that sucked less than the dual mode API.
