/**
 * This format describes changes that must be applied to a document tree in order to update it.
 * Instances of this format are generated based on incoming changesets and consumed by a view layer (e.g., Forest) to
 * update itself.
 *
 * Because this format is only meant for updating document state, it does not fully represent user intentions.
 * For example, if some edit A inserts content and some subsequent edit B deletes that content, then a Delta that
 * represents the state update for these two edits would not include the insertion and deletion.
 * For the same reason, this format is also not fit to be rebased in the face of concurrent changes.
 * Instead this format is used to describe the end product of rebasing user intentions over concurrent edits.
 *
 * This format is self-contained in the following ways:
 *
 * 1. It uses integer indices (offsets, technically) to describe necessary changes.
 * As such, it does not rely on document nodes being randomly accessible by ID.
 *
 * 2. This format does not require historical information in order to apply the changes it describes.
 * For example, if a user undoes the deletion of a subtree, then the Delta generated for the undo edit will contain all
 * information necessary to re-create the subtree from scratch.
 *
 * This format can be generated from any Changeset without having access to the current document state.
 *
 * This format is meant to serve as the lowest common denominator to represent state changes resulting from any kind
 * of operation on any kind of field.
 * This means all such operations must be expressible in terms of this format.
 *
 * Future work:
 * - Define where and how field-specific and operation-specific metadata is meant to be represented.
 * - Add a move table to describe the src and dst paths of move operations.
 *
 * Within the above design constrains, this format is designed with the following goals in mind:
 *
 * 1. Make it easy to walk both a document tree and the delta tree to apply the changes described in the delta
 * with a minimum amount of backtracking over the contents of the tree.
 * This a boon for both code simplicity and performance.
 *
 * 2. Make the format terse.
 *
 * 3. Make the format uniform.
 *
 * These goals are reflected in the following design choices (this is very much optional reading for users of this
 * format):
 *
 * 1. All marks that apply to field elements are represented in a single linear structure where marks that affect later
 * element of the document field appear after marks that affect earlier elements of the document field.
 *
 * If the marks were not ordered in this fashion then a consumer would need to backtrack within the document field.
 *
 * If the marks were represented in multiple such linear structures then it would be necessary to either:
 * - backtrack when iterating over one structure fully, then the next
 * - maintain a pointer within each such linear structure and advance them in lock-step (like in a k-way merge-sort but
 * more fiddly because of the offsets).
 *
 * The drawback of this design choice is that it relies heavily on polymorphism:
 * for each mark encountered a reader has to check which kind of mark it is.
 * This is a source of code and time complexity in the reader code and adds a memory overhead to the format since each
 * mark has to carry a tag field to announce what kind of mark it is.
 *
 * 2. `MoveIn` marks in inserted portions of the document are inlined in their corresponding `ProtoField`.
 *
 * If the MoveIn marks were represented in a separate sub-structure (like they are under moved-in portions of the tree)
 * then the representation would forced to describe the path to them (in the form field keys and field offsets) from
 * the root of the inserted portion of the tree.
 * This would have two adverse effects:
 * - It would make the format less terse since this same path information would be redundant (it is already included in
 * the ProtoTree).
 * - It would lead the consumer of the format first build the inserted subtree, then traverse it again from its root to
 * apply the relevant `MoveIn` marks.
 *
 *
 * 3. Modifications of deleted and moved-out nodes are represented using modify marks within `Delete` and `MoveOut`
 * marks.
 * This is in opposition to a structure where the fact that a modified node is being deleted or moved-out would
 * be represented a `Modify` mark like so:
 * ```typescript
 * interface ModifyAndDelete {
 *   type: typeof MarkType.ModifyAndDelete;
 *   fields: FieldMap<PositionedMarks<ModifyDeleted | MoveOut>>;
 * }
 * interface ModifyAndMoveOut {
 *   type: typeof MarkType.ModifyAndMoveOut;
 *   moveId: MoveId;
 *   fields: FieldMap<PositionedMarks<ModifyMovedOut | MoveOut>>;
 * }
 * export interface Delete {
 *   type: typeof MarkType.Delete;
 *   count: number;
 * }
 * export interface MoveOut {
 *   type: typeof MarkType.MoveOut;
 *   count: number;
 *   moveId: MoveId;
 * }
 * ```
 * Note the absence of modify information in `Delete` and `MoveOut` above.
 *
 * The benefit of the chosen representation over the alternative are two-fold:
 * - It leads to less splitting of moved and deleted ranges of nodes.
 * - It makes the format more uniform since modifications to moved-in subtrees must be represented with modifications
 * marks within a `MoveIn` mark.
 *
 * 4. `MoveIn` marks are represented in the location where the content being moved resides in the input context that
 * the delta is applied to, and `MoveOut` marks are represented in the location where the content being moved should
 * reside after the delta is applied.
 *
 * The alternative would be to allow such marks to appear in temporary locations (e.g., in field "bar" for a
 * transaction that moves content from "foo" to "bar" then moves that same content from "bar" to "baz").
 * This makes the format less terse and harder to reason about.
 *
 * 5. MoveIn marks are not inlined within `ProtoField`s.
 *
 * Inlining them would force the consuming code to detect `MoveIn` marks within the `ProtoField` and handle them
 * within the context of the insert.
 * This would be cumbersome because either the code that is responsible for consuming the `ProtoField` would need to
 * be aware of and have the context to handle `MoveIn`, or some caller of that code would need to find and extract such
 * `MoveIn` marks ahead to calling that code.
