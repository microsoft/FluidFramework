/**
 * This format describes changes that must be applied to a forest in order to update it.
 * Instances of this format are generated based on incoming changesets and consumed by a view layer (e.g., Forest) to
 * update itself.
 *
 * Because this format is only meant for updating document state, it does not fully represent user intentions.
 * For example, if some concurrent edits A and B insert content at the same location, then a Delta that represents
 * represents the state update for edit A would not include information that allows B's insertion to be ordered
 * relative to A's insertion. This format is therefore not fit to be rebased in the face of concurrent changes.
 * Instead this format is used to describe the end product of rebasing user intentions over concurrent edits.
 *
 * This format is self-contained in the following ways:
 *
 * 1. It uses integer indices (offsets, technically) to describe the locations of necessary changes.
 * As such, it does not rely on document nodes being accessible/locatable by ID.
 *
 * 2. This format does not require historical information in order to apply the changes it describes.
 * For example, if a user undoes the deletion of a subtree, then the Delta generated for the undo edit will contain all
 * information necessary to restore that subtree.
 *
 * This format can be generated from any Changeset without having access to the current document state.
 *
 * This format is meant to serve as the lowest common denominator to represent state changes resulting from any kind
 * of operation on any kind of field.
 * This means all such operations must be expressible in terms of this format.
 *
 * Within the above design constrains, this format is designed with the following goals in mind:
 *
 * 1. Make it easy to walk both a document tree and the delta tree to apply the changes described in the delta
 * with a minimum amount of backtracking over the contents of the tree.
 * This a boon for both code simplicity and performance.
 *
 * 2. Make the format terse.
 *
 * 3. Make the format uniform.
 *
 * These goals are reflected in the following design choices (this is very much optional reading for users of this
 * format):
 *
 * 1. All marks that apply to field elements are represented in a single linear structure where marks that affect later
 * elements of the document field appear after marks that affect earlier elements of the document field.
 *
 * If the marks were not ordered in this fashion then a consumer would need to backtrack within the document field.
 *
 * If the marks were represented in multiple such linear structures then it would be necessary to either:
 * - backtrack when iterating over one structure fully, then the next
 * - maintain a pointer within each such linear structure and advance them in lock-step (like in a k-way merge-sort but
 * more fiddly because of the offsets).
 *
 * 2. Nested changes are not inlined within `ProtoNode`s.
 *
 * Inlining them would force the consuming code to detect such changes within the `ProtoNode` and handle them
 * within the context of the content creation.
 * This would be cumbersome because either the code that is responsible for consuming the `ProtoNode` would need to
 * be aware of and have the context to handle such changes, or some caller of that code would need to find and extract such
 * change information ahead to calling that code.
