     * Note that once there are zero dependents (before running the `onDispose` callback),
     * this object is no longer usable as a Dependee,
     * and thus it is an error to call `registerDependent`.
     * This means `onDispose` will be invoked at most once.
     *
     * It is an error to call `endInitialization` more than once.
     * If called, it should be called by the creator of this DisposingDependee after adding initial dependencies.
     *
     * "initialization mode" exists to handle a couple of edge cases where the simpler approach of just
     * disposing when last dependee is removed would not work:
     * - No dependents were added in initialization: would never get disposed.
     * - A dependent was added, then removed, then a second one added during initialization:
     * the second dependent would be added after this was disposed, which is invalid.
     *
     * This first case is actually pretty easy to hit on accident even in a lazy system,
     * since sometimes the context which takes the dependency does not need dependency tracking
     * (ex: its a one time event and not a projection).
     * This scenario is the main motivating factor behind this particular API design.
     *
     * Another way to think about this is "initialization mode" effectively holds an extra ref count to this Dependee,
     * keeping it alive while its in-scope for its creator to add dependents to.
     *
     * @param onDispose - run once there are no dependents.
     * Will be during this call to endInitialization if there are currently no dependents.
