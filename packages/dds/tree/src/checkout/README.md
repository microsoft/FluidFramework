# Checkout

Implementation of Checkout.

Drives the content of a forest.

Accepts external edits (ex: Changeset after rebasing from SharedTree), and composes them with forest and progress transactions to provide a a nice app facing API with snapshot isolation.

# Status

Implementation is really just some notes/ideas, and nothing close to usable.
