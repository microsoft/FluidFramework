 * A {@link JsonValidator} implementation which uses TypeBox's JSON schema validator.

 * the intent of factoring JSON validation into an interface is to make validation more pay-to-play
 * (i.e. a JSON validator is only included in an application's bundle if that application references it).
 *
 * Defining this validator in its own file also helps to ensure it is tree-shakeable.
