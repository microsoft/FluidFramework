 * This field kind is stored in the test directory as an example of a field kind implementation.
 *
 * This is an example of a few interesting things:
 *
 * - A field kind with some constraints on what can be under it type wise.
 * Other possible examples which would do this include sets, maps (for their keys),
 * or any domain specific specialized kinds.
 *
 * - A field kind with commutative edits.
 *
 * TODO:
 * What should the subtrees under this look like?
 * How does it prevent / interact with direct edits to the subtree (ex: set value)?
 * How should it use its type set?
 * How should it handle lack of associative addition due to precision and overflow?
