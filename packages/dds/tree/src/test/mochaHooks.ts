 * Ideally testing for production style use would be done by producing an actual production bundle and testing that,
 * but configuring that is more difficult and this is a useful approximation for now.
 *
 * Currently this configuration is not run automatically.
 * As this currently only disables debugAsserts and development-only assert messages, the chances of regressions are low.
 * Currently it's considered better to spend the testing time on running more fuzz tests.
 * Some test suites where regressions are more likely do their own testing with and without `emulateProductionBuild`,
 * further reducing the need to run this configuration regularly.
