	 *
	 * Specifying a stored key that differs from the property key is particularly useful in refactoring scenarios.
	 * To update the developer-facing API, while maintaining backwards compatibility with existing SharedTree data,
	 * you can change the property key and specify the previous property key as the stored key.
	 *
	 * Notes:
	 *
	 * - Stored keys have no impact on standard JavaScript behavior, on tree nodes. For example, `Object.keys`
	 * will always return the property keys specified in the schema, ignoring any stored keys that differ from
	 * the property keys.
	 *
	 * - When specifying stored keys in an object schema, you must ensure that the final set of stored keys
	 * (accounting for those implicitly derived from property keys) contains no duplicates.
	 * This is validated at runtime.
	 *
	 * @example Refactoring code without breaking compatibility with existing data
	 *
	 * Consider some existing object schema:
	 *
	 * ```TypeScript
	 * class Point extends schemaFactory.object("Point", {
	 * 	xPosition: schemaFactory.number,
	 * 	yPosition: schemaFactory.number,
	 * 	zPosition: schemaFactory.optional(schemaFactory.number),
	 * });
	 * ```
	 *
	 * Developers using nodes of this type would access the the `xPosition` property as `point.xPosition`.
	 *
	 * We would like to refactor the schema to omit "Position" from the property keys, but application data has
	 * already been persisted using the original property keys. To maintain compatibility with existing data,
	 * we can refactor the schema as follows:
	 *
	 * ```TypeScript
	 * class Point extends schemaFactory.object("Point", {
	 * 	x: schemaFactory.required(schemaFactory.number, { key: "xPosition" }),
	 * 	y: schemaFactory.required(schemaFactory.number, { key: "yPosition" }),
	 * 	z: schemaFactory.optional(schemaFactory.number, { key: "zPosition" }),
	 * });
	 * ```
	 *
	 * Now, developers can access the `x` property as `point.x`, while existing data can still be collaborated on.
	 *
	 * @defaultValue If not specified, the key that is persisted is the property key that was specified in the schema.
