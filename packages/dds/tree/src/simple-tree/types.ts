 * @privateRemarks
 * Future changes may replace this with a branded interface if the runtime oddities related to this are not cleaned up.
 *
 * Currently not all node implications include this in their prototype chain (some hide it with a proxy), and thus cause `instanceof` to fail.
 * This results in the runtime and compile time behavior of `instanceof` differing.
 * TypeScript 5.3 allows altering the compile time behavior of `instanceof`.
 * The runtime behavior can be changed by implementing `Symbol.hasInstance`.
 * One of those approaches could be used to resolve this inconsistency if TreeNode is kept as a class.

	 * This is added to prevent TypeScript from implicitly allowing non-TreeNode types to be used as TreeNodes.
	 * @privateRemarks
	 * This is a JavaScript private field, so is not accessible from outside this class.
	 * This prevents it from having name collisions with object fields.
	 * Since this is private, the type of this field is stripped in the d.ts file.
	 * To get matching type checking within and from outside the package, the least informative type (`unknown`) is used.
	 * To avoid this having any runtime impact, the field is uninitialized.
	 *
	 * Making this field optional results in different type checking within this project than outside of it, since the d.ts file drops the optional aspect of the field.
	 * This is extra confusing since sin ce the tests get in-project typing for intellisense and separate project checking at build time.
	 * To avoid all this mess, this field is required, not optional.
	 *
	 * Another option would be to use a symbol (possibly as a private field).
	 * That approach ran into some strange difficulties causing SchemaFactory to fail to compile, and was not investigated further.
	 *
	 * TODO: This is disabled due to compilation of this project not targeting es2022,
	 * which causes this to polyfill to use of a weak map which has some undesired runtime overhead.
	 * Consider enabling this for stronger typing after targeting es2022.
	 * The [type] symbol here provides a lot of the value this private brand would, but is not all of it:
	 * someone could manually make an object literal with it and pass it off as a node: this private brand would prevent that.
	 * Another option would be to add a protected or private symbol, which would also get the stronger typing.
