	 * This is a JavaScript private field, so is not accessible from outside this class.
	 * This prevents it from having name collisions with object fields.
	 * Since this is private, the type of this field is stripped in the d.ts file.
	 * To get matching type checking within and from outside the package, the least informative type (`unknown`) is used.

	 * This is extra confusing since since the tests get in-project typing for intellisense and separate project checking at build time.
	 * To avoid all this mess, this field is required, not optional.
