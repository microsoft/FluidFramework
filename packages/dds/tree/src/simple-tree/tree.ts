	 *
	 * @remarks
	 * If the tree is uninitialized (has no schema and no content), the tree is initialized with the `initialTree` and
	 * view `schema` in the provided `config`.
	 *
	 * The tree (now known to have been initialized) has its stored schema checked against the provided view schema.
	 *
	 * If the schemas are compatible, the returned {@link TreeView} will expose the root with a schema-aware API based on the provided view schema.
	 *
	 * If the schemas are not compatible, the view will indicate the error.
	 *
	 * Note that other clients can modify the document at any time, causing the view to enter or leave this error state: see {@link TreeView.events} for how to handle invalidation in these cases.

	 * @privateRemarks
	 * TODO: Provide a way to make a generic view schema for any document.
	 * TODO: Support adapters for handling out-of-schema data.
	 *
	 * Doing initialization here allows a small API that is hard to use incorrectly.
	 * Other approaches tend to have easy-to-make mistakes.
	 * For example, having a separate initialization function means apps can forget to call it, making an app that can only open existing documents,
	 * or call it unconditionally leaving an app that can only create new documents.
	 * It also would require the schema to be passed into separate places and could cause issues if they didn't match.
	 * Since the initialization function couldn't return a typed tree, the type checking wouldn't help catch that.
	 * Also, if an app manages to create a document, but the initialization fails to get persisted, an app that only calls the initialization function
	 * on the create code-path (for example how a schematized factory might do it),
	 * would leave the document in an unusable state which could not be repaired when it is reopened (by the same or other clients).
	 * Additionally, once out of schema content adapters are properly supported (with lazy document updates),
	 * this initialization could become just another out of schema content adapter and this initialization is no longer a special case.

 * @privateRemarks
 * From an API design perspective, `upgradeSchema` could be merged into `schematize` anb/or `schematize` could return errors explicitly.

 * Doing that would however complicate trivial "hello world" style example slightly, as well as be a breaking API change.
 * It also seems more complex to handle invalidation with that pattern.
 * Thus this design was chosen at the risk of apps blindly accessing `root` then breaking unexpectedly when the document is incompatible.
 * If this does become a problem,
 * it could be mitigated by adding a `rootOrError` member and deprecating `root` to give users a warning if they might be missing the error checking.
