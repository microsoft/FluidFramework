/**
 * Extends SchemaFactory with utilities for recursive schema.
 * @see {@link ValidateRecursiveSchema}
 * @remarks
 * This is separated from {@link SchemaFactory} as these APIs are more experimental and may be stabilized independently.
 *
 * The non-recursive versions of the schema building methods will run into several issues when used recursively.
 * Consider the following example:
 *
 * ```typescript
 * const Test = sf.array(Test); // Bad
 * ```
 *
 * This has several issues:
 *
 * 1. It is a structurally named schema.
 * Structurally named schema derive their name from the names of their child types, which is not possible when the type is recursive since its name would include itself.
 * Instead a name must be explicitly provided.
 *
 * 2. The schema accesses itself before it's defined.
 * This would be a runtime error if the TypeScript compiler allowed it.
 * This can be fixed by wrapping the type in a function, which also requires explicitly listing the allowed types in an array (`[() => Test]`).
 *
 * 3. TypeScript fails to infer the recursive type and falls back to `any` with the warning or error (depending on the compiler configuration):
 * `'Test' implicitly has type 'any' because it does not have a type annotation and is referenced directly or indirectly in its own initializer.ts(7022)`.
 * This issue is what the specialized recursive schema building methods fix.
 * This fix comes at a cost: to make the recursive cases work, the `extends` clauses had to be removed.
 * This means that mistakes declaring recursive schema often don't give compile errors in the schema.
 * Additionally support for implicit construction had to be disabled.
 * This means that new nested {@link Unhydrated} nodes can not be created like `new Test([[]])`.
 * Instead the nested nodes must be created explicitly using the construction like`new Test([new Test([])])`.
 *
 * 4. It is using "POJO" mode since it's not explicitly declaring a new class.
 * This means that if the schema generated d.ts files replace recursive references with `any`, breaking use of recursive schema across compilation boundaries.
 * This is fixed by explicitly creating a class which extends the returned schema.
 *
 * All together, the fixed version looks like:
 * ```typescript
 * class Test extends sf.arrayRecursive("Test", [() => Test]) {} // Good
 * ```
 *
 * Be very careful when declaring recursive schema.
 * Due to the removed extends clauses, subtle mistakes will compile just fine but cause strange errors when the schema is used.
 *
 * For example if the square brackets around the allowed types are forgotten:
 *
 * ```typescript
 * class Test extends sf.arrayRecursive("Test", () => Test) {} // Bad
 * ```
 * This schema will still compile, and some (but not all) usages of it may look like they work correctly while other usages will produce generally unintelligible compile errors.
 * This issue can be partially mitigated using {@link ValidateRecursiveSchema}.
