/**
 * Compile time check for validity of a recursive schema.
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * class Test extends sf.arrayRecursive("Test", [() => Test]) {}
 * {
 *     type _check = ValidateRecursiveSchema<typeof Test>;
 * }
 * ```
 * @remarks
 * The type of a recursive schema can be passed to this, and a compile error will be produced for some of the cases of malformed schema.
 * This can be used to help mitigate the issue that recursive schema definitions are {@link Unenforced}.
 * If an issue is encountered where a mistake in a recursive schema is made which produces an invalid schema but is not rejected by this checker,
 * it should be considered a bug and this should be updated to handle that case (or have a disclaimer added to these docs that it misses that case).
 *
 * # Recursive Schema
 *
 * The non-recursive versions of the schema building methods will run into several issues when used recursively.
 * Consider the following example:
 *
 * ```typescript
 * const Test = sf.array(Test); // Bad
 * ```
 *
 * This has several issues:
 *
 * 1. It is a structurally named schema.
 * Structurally named schema derive their name from the names of their child types, which is not possible when the type is recursive since its name would include itself.
 * Instead a name must be explicitly provided.
 *
 * 2. The schema accesses itself before it's defined.
 * This would be a runtime error if the TypeScript compiler allowed it.
 * This can be fixed by wrapping the type in a function, which also requires explicitly listing the allowed types in an array (`[() => Test]`).
 *
 * 3. TypeScript fails to infer the recursive type and falls back to `any` with this warning or error (depending on the compiler configuration):
 * `'Test' implicitly has type 'any' because it does not have a type annotation and is referenced directly or indirectly in its own initializer.ts(7022)`.
 * This issue is what the specialized recursive schema building methods fix.
 * This fix comes at a cost: to make the recursive cases work, the `extends` clauses had to be removed.
 * This means that mistakes declaring recursive schema often don't give compile errors in the schema.
 * Additionally support for implicit construction had to be disabled.
 * This means that new nested {@link Unhydrated} nodes can not be created like `new Test([[]])`.
 * Instead the nested nodes must be created explicitly using the construction like`new Test([new Test([])])`.
 *
 * 4. It is using "POJO" mode since it's not explicitly declaring a new class.
 * This means that the generated d.ts files for the schema replace recursive references with `any`, breaking use of recursive schema across compilation boundaries.
 * This is fixed by explicitly creating a class which extends the returned schema.
 *
 * All together, the fixed version looks like:
 * ```typescript
 * class Test extends sf.arrayRecursive("Test", [() => Test]) {} // Good
 * ```
 *
 * Be very careful when declaring recursive schema.
 * Due to the removed extends clauses, subtle mistakes will compile just fine but cause strange errors when the schema is used.
 *
 * For example if the square brackets around the allowed types are forgotten:
 *
 * ```typescript
 * class Test extends sf.arrayRecursive("Test", () => Test) {} // Bad
 * ```
 * This schema will still compile, and some (but not all) usages of it may look like they work correctly while other usages will produce generally unintelligible compile errors.
 * This issue can be partially mitigated using {@link ValidateRecursiveSchema}:
 *
 * ```typescript
 * class Test extends sf.arrayRecursive("Test", () => Test) {} // Bad
 * {
 *     type _check = ValidateRecursiveSchema<typeof Test>; // Reports compile error due to invalid schema above.
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * @privateRemarks
 * There are probably mistakes this misses: it's hard to guess all the wrong things people will accidentally do and defend against them.
 * Hopefully over time this can grow toward being robust, at least for common mistakes.
 *
 * This check duplicates logic that ideally would be entirely decided by the actual schema building methods.
 * Therefore changes to those methods may require updating `ValidateRecursiveSchema`.
