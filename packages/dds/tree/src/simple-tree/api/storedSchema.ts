/**
 * Dumps the "persisted" schema subset of the provided `schema` into a deterministic JSON-compatible, semi-human-readable, but unspecified format.
 *
 * @remarks
 * This can be used to help inspect schema for debugging, and to save a snapshot of schema to help detect and review changes to an applications schema.
 *
 * This format may change across major versions of this package: such changes are considered breaking.
 * Beyond that, no compatibility guarantee is provided for this format: it should never be relied upon to load data, it should only be used for comparing outputs from this function.
 *
 * This only includes the "persisted" subset of schema information, which means the portion which gets included in documents.
 * It thus uses "persisted" keys, see {@link FieldProps.key}.
 *
 * If two schema have identical "persisted" schema, then they are considered {@link SchemaCompatibilityStatus.isEquivalent|equivalent}.
 *
 * See also {@link comparePersistedSchema}.
 *
 * @example
 * An application could use this API to generate a `schema.json` file when it first releases,
 * then test that the schema is sill compatible with documents from that version with a test like :
 * ```typescript
 * assert.deepEqual(extractPersistedSchema(MySchema), require("./schema.json"));
 * ```
 *
 * @privateRemarks
 * This currently uses the schema summary format, but that could be changed to something more human readable (particularly if the encoded format becomes less human readable).
 * This intentionally does not leak the format types in the API.
 *
 * Public API surface uses "persisted" terminology while internally we use "stored".

 * Compares two schema extracted using {@link extractPersistedSchema}.
 * Reports the same compatibility that {@link TreeView.compatibility} would report if
 * opening a document that used the `persisted` schema and provided `view` to {@link ViewableTree.viewWith}.
 *
 * @param persisted - Schema persisted for a document. Typically persisted alongside the data and assumed to describe that data.
 * @param view - Schema which would be used to view persisted content. Use {@link extractPersistedSchema} to convert the view schema into this format.
 * @param options - {@link ICodecOptions} used when parsing the provided schema.
 * @param canInitialize - Passed through to the return value unchanged and otherwise unused.
 * @returns The {@link SchemaCompatibilityStatus} a {@link TreeView} would report for this combination of schema.
 *
 * @remarks
 * This uses the persisted formats for schema, meaning it only includes data which impacts compatibility.
 * It also uses the persisted format so that this API can be used in tests to compare against saved schema from previous versions of the application.
 *
 * @example
 * An application could use {@link extractPersistedSchema} to generate a `schema.json` file for various versions of the app,
 * then test that documents using those schema can be upgraded to work with the current schema using a test like:
