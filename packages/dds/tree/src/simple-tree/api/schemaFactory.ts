	 *
	 * @defaultValue `false`
	 * @remarks
	 * The advantage of enabling this option is that it allows an application ecosystem with staged rollout to more quickly
	 * upgrade documents to include schema for new optional features.
	 *
	 * However, it does come with trade-offs that applications should weigh carefully when it comes to interactions between
	 * code and documents.
	 * When opening such documents, the API presented is still determined by the view schema.
	 * This can have implications on the behavior of edits or code which uses portions of the view schema,
	 * since this may inadvertently drop data which is present in those optional fields in the document schema.
	 *
	 * Consider the following example:
	 *
	 * ```typescript
	 * const sf = new SchemaFactory("com.example");
	 * class PersonView extends sf.object("Person", { name: sf.string }, { allowUnknownOptionalFields: true }) {}
	 * class PersonStored extends sf.object("Person", { name: sf.string, nickname: sf.optional(sf.string) }) {}
	 *
	 * // Say we have a document which uses `PersonStored` in its schema, and application code constructs
	 * // a tree view using `PersonView`. If the application for some reason had implemented a function like this:
	 * function clonePerson(a: PersonView): PersonView {
	 * 	return new PersonView({ name: a.name });
	 * }
	 * // ...or even like this:
	 * function clonePerson(a: PersonView): PersonView {
	 *  return new PersonView({ ...a})
	 * }
	 * // Then the alleged clone wouldn't actually clone the entire person in either case, it would drop the nickname.
	 * ```
	 *
	 * If an application wants to be particularly careful to preserve all data on a node when editing it, it can use
	 * {@link TreeAlpha.(importVerbose:2)|import}/{@link TreeAlpha.(exportVerbose:2)|export} APIs with persistent keys.
	 *
	 * Note that public API methods which operate on entire nodes (such as `moveTo`, `moveToEnd`, etc. on arrays) do not encounter
	 * this problem as SharedTree's implementation stores the entire node in its lower layers. It's only when application code
	 * reaches into a node (either by accessing its fields, spreading it, or some other means) that this problem arises.

 * @typeParam TName - Type of names used to identify each schema produced in this factory.
 * Typically this is just `string` but it is also possible to use `string` or `number` based enums if you prefer to identify your types that way.
 *
 * @remarks
 * For details related to inputting data constrained by schema (including via assignment), and how non-exact schema types are handled in general refer to {@link Input}.
 * For information about recursive schema support, see methods postfixed with "recursive" and {@link ValidateRecursiveSchema}.
 * To apply schema defined with this factory to a tree, see {@link ViewableTree.viewWith} and {@link TreeViewConfiguration}.
 *
 * All schema produced by this factory get a {@link TreeNodeSchemaCore.identifier|unique identifier} by combining the {@link SchemaFactory.scope} with the schema's `Name`.
 * The `Name` part may be explicitly provided as a parameter, or inferred as a structural combination of the provided types.
 * The APIs which use this second approach, structural naming, also deduplicate all equivalent calls.
 * Therefor two calls to `array(allowedTypes)` with the same allowedTypes will return the same {@link TreeNodeSchema} instance.
 * On the other hand, two calls to `array(name, allowedTypes)` will always return different {@link TreeNodeSchema} instances
 * and it is an error to use both in the same tree (since their identifiers are not unique).
 *
 * Note:
 * POJO stands for Plain Old JavaScript Object.
 * This means an object that works like a `{}` style object literal.
 * In this case it means the prototype is `Object.prototype` and acts like a set of key value pairs (data, not methods).
 * The usage below generalizes this to include array and map like objects as well.
 *
 * There are two ways to use these APIs:
 *
 * Customizable Approach:
 *
 * 1. Declaration: `class X extends schemaFactory.object("x", {}) {}`
 *
 * 2. Allows adding "local" (non-persisted) members: Yes. Members (including methods) can be added to the class.
 *
 * 3. Prototype: The user-defined class.
 *
 * 4. Structurally named Schema: Not Supported.
 *
 * 5. Explicitly named Objects: Supported.
 *
 * 6. Explicitly named Maps and Arrays: Supported: Both declaration approaches can be used.
 *
 * 7. Node.js `assert.deepEqual`: Compares like class instances: equal to other nodes of the same type with the same content, including custom local fields.
 *
 * 8. IntelliSense: Shows and links to user-defined class by name: `X`.
 *
 * 9. Recursion: Supported with special declaration patterns.
 *
 * POJO Emulation Approach:
 *
 * 1. Declaration: `const X = schemaFactory.object("x", {}); type X = NodeFromSchema<typeof X>;`
 *
 * 2. Allows adding "local" (non-persisted) members: No. Attempting to set non-field members will result in an error.
 *
 * 3. Prototype: `Object.prototype`, `Map.prototype`, or `Array.prototype` depending on node kind.
 *
 * 4. Structurally named Schema: Supported.
 *
 * 5. Explicitly named Objects: Supported.
 *
 * 6. Explicitly named Maps and Arrays: Not Supported.
 *
 * 7. Node.js `assert.deepEqual`: Compares like plain objects: equal to plain JavaScript objects with the same fields, and other nodes with the same fields, even if the types are different.
 *
 * 8. IntelliSense: Shows internal type generation logic: `object & TreeNode & ObjectFromSchemaRecord<{}> & WithType<"test.x">`.
 *
 * 9. Recursion: Unsupported: Generated `.d.ts` files replace recursive references with `any`, breaking the use of recursive schema across compilation boundaries.
 *
 * Note that while "POJO Emulation" nodes act a lot like POJO objects, they are not true POJO objects:
 *
 * - Adding new arbitrary fields will error, as well some cases of invalid edits.
 *
 * - They are implemented using proxies.
 *
 * - They have state that is not exposed via enumerable own properties, including a {@link TreeNodeSchema}.
 * This makes libraries like node.js `assert.deepEqual` fail to detect differences in type.
 *
 * - Assigning members has side effects (in this case editing the persisted/shared tree).
 *
 * - Not all operations implied by the prototype will work correctly: stick to the APIs explicitly declared in the TypeScript types.
 *
 * @privateRemarks
 * It's perfectly possible to make `POJO Emulation` mode (or even just hiding the prototype) selectable even when using the custom user class declaration syntax.
 * When doing this, it's still possible to make `instanceof` perform correctly.
 * Allowing (or banning) custom/out-of-schema properties on the class is also possible in both modes: it could be orthogonal.
 * Also for consistency, if keeping the current approach to detecting `POJO Emulation` mode it might make sense to make explicitly named Maps and Arrays do the detection the same as how object does it.
 *
 * Note: the comparison between the customizable and POJO modes is not done in a table because TSDoc does not currently have support for embedded markdown.

		 * Then each schema in the library get a name which is unique within the library.
		 * The scope and name are joined (with a period) to form the {@link TreeNodeSchemaCore.identifier|schema identifier}.
		 * Following this pattern allows a single application to depend on multiple libraries which define their own schema, and use them together in a single tree without risk of collisions.
		 * If a library logically contains sub-libraries with their own schema, they can be given a scope nested inside the parent scope, such as "ParentScope.ChildScope".
		 *
		 * To avoid collisions between the scopes of libraries
		 * it is recommended that the libraries use {@link https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_domain_name_notation | Reverse domain name notation} or a UUIDv4 for their scope.
		 * If this pattern is followed, application can safely use third party libraries without risk of the schema in them colliding.
		 *
		 * You may opt out of using a scope by passing `undefined`, but note that this increases the risk of collisions.
		 *
		 * @example
		 * Fluid Framework follows this pattern, placing the schema for the built in leaf types in the `com.fluidframework.leaf` scope.
		 * If Fluid Framework publishes more schema in the future, they would be under some other `com.fluidframework` scope.
		 * This ensures that any schema defined by any other library will not conflict with Fluid Framework's schema
		 * as long as the library uses the recommended patterns for how to scope its schema..
		 *
		 * @example
		 * A library could generate a random UUIDv4, like `242c4397-49ed-47e6-8dd0-d5c3bc31778b` and use that as the scope.
		 * Note: do not use this UUID: a new one must be randomly generated when needed to ensure collision resistance.

	/**
	 * A special field which holds a unique identifier for an object node.

	 * The value of this field, a "node identifier", uniquely identifies a node among all other nodes in the tree.
	 * Node identifiers are strings, and can therefore be used as lookup keys in maps or written to a database.
	 * When the node is constructed, the identifier field does not need to be populated.
	 * The SharedTree will provide an identifier for the node automatically.
	 * An identifier provided automatically by the SharedTree has the following properties:
	 * - It is a UUID.
	 * - It is compressed to a space-efficient representation when stored in the document.
	 * - A compressed form of the identifier can be accessed at runtime via the `Tree.shortId()` API.
	 * - It will error if read (and will not be present in the object's iterable properties) before the node has been inserted into the tree.
	 *
	 * However, a user may alternatively supply their own string as the identifier if desired (for example, if importing identifiers from another system).
	 * In that case, it is up to the user to ensure that the identifier is unique within the current tree - no other node should have the same identifier at the same time.
	 * If the identifier is not unique, it may be read, but may cause libraries or features which operate over node identifiers to misbehave.
	 * User-supplied identifiers may be read immediately, even before insertion into the tree.
	 *
	 * A node may have more than one identifier field (though note that this precludes the use of the `Tree.shortId()` API).
