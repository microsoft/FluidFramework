	 * @remarks
	 * If the tree is uninitialized (has no schema and no content), use {@link TreeView.initialize} on the returned view to set the schema and content together.
	 * Using `viewWith` followed by {@link TreeView.upgradeSchema} to initialize only the schema for a document is technically valid when the schema

	 * Note that other clients can modify the document at any time, causing the view to change its compatibility status: see {@link TreeView.events} for how to handle invalidation in these cases.

	 * or call it unconditionally leaving an app that can only create new documents.
	 * It also would require the schema to be passed into separate places and could cause issues if they didn't match.
	 * Since the initialization function couldn't return a typed tree, the type checking wouldn't help catch that.
	 * Also, if an app manages to create a document, but the initialization fails to get persisted, an app that only calls the initialization function
	 * on the create code-path (for example how a schematized factory might do it),
	 * would leave the document in an unusable state which could not be repaired when it is reopened (by the same or other clients).
	 * Additionally, once out of schema content adapters are properly supported (with lazy document updates),
	 * this initialization could become just another out of schema content adapter and this initialization is no longer a special case.

	/**
	 * A flag used to opt into strict rules ensuring that the schema avoids cases which can make the type of nodes ambiguous when importing or exporting data.

	 *
	 * @remarks
	 * When this is true, it ensures that the compile time type safety for data when constructing nodes is sufficient to ensure that the runtime behavior will not give node data ambiguity errors.
	 *
	 * This ensures that the canonical JSON-like representation of all unions in the tree are lossless and unambiguous.
	 * This canonical JSON-like representation consists of arrays, plain old JavaScript objects with string keys, booleans, numbers (excluding NaN, -0 and infinities), strings, null and {@link @fluidframework/core-interfaces#IFluidHandle}s.
	 * It is compatible with the node creation APIs (such as schema class constructors) and is also compatible with JSON assuming any IFluidHandles get special handling (since they are not JSON compatible).
	 * Currently these cases can cause ambiguity in a union:
	 *
	 * - More than one ArrayNode type: it's impossible to tell which array type is intended in the case of empty arrays (`[]`).
	 *
	 * - More than one MapNode type: it's impossible to tell which map type is intended in the case of an empty map (`{}`).
	 *
	 * - Both a MapNode and an ArrayNode: this case is not a problem for the canonical JSON representation, but is an issue when constructing from an Iterable, which is supported for both MapNode and ArrayNode.
	 *
	 * - Both a MapNode and an ObjectNode: when the input is valid for the ObjectNode, the current parser always considers it ambiguous with being a MapNode.
	 *
	 * - ObjectNodes which have fields (required or optional) which include all required fields of another ObjectNode: currently each ObjectNode is differentiated by the presence of its required fields.
	 *
	 * This check is conservative: some complex cases may error if the current simple algorithm cannot show no ambiguity is possible.
	 * This check may become more permissive over time.
	 *
	 * @example Ambiguous schema (with `preventAmbiguity: false`), and how to disambiguate it using {@link Unhydrated} nodes:
	 * ```typescript
	 * const schemaFactory = new SchemaFactory("com.example");
	 * class Feet extends schemaFactory.object("Feet", { length: schemaFactory.number }) {}
	 * class Meters extends schemaFactory.object("Meters", { length: schemaFactory.number }) {}
	 * const config = new TreeViewConfiguration({
	 * 	// This combination of schema can lead to ambiguous cases and will error if `preventAmbiguity` is true.
	 * 	schema: [Feet, Meters],
	 * 	preventAmbiguity: false,
	 * });
	 * const view = tree.viewWith(config);
	 * // This is invalid since it is ambiguous which type of node is being constructed:
	 * // view.initialize({ length: 5 });
	 * // To work, an explicit type can be provided by using an {@link Unhydrated} Node:
	 * view.initialize(new Meters({ length: 5 }));
	 * ```
	 *
	 * @example Schema disambiguated by adjusting field names, validated with `preventAmbiguity: true:`
	 * ```typescript
	 * const schemaFactory = new SchemaFactory("com.example");
	 * class Feet extends schemaFactory.object("Feet", { length: schemaFactory.number }) {}
	 * class Meters extends schemaFactory.object("Meters", {
	 * 	// To avoid ambiguity when parsing unions of Feet and Meters, this renames the length field to "meters".
	 * 	// To preserve compatibility with existing data from the ambiguous case,
	 * 	// `{ key: "length" }` is set, so when persisted in the tree "length" is used as the field name.
	 * 	meters: schemaFactory.required(schemaFactory.number, { key: "length" }),
	 * }) {}
	 * const config = new TreeViewConfiguration({
	 * 	// This combination of schema is not ambiguous because `Feet` and `Meters` have different required keys.
	 * 	schema: [Feet, Meters],
	 * 	preventAmbiguity: true,
	 * });
	 * const view = tree.viewWith(config);
	 * // This now works, since the field is sufficient to determine this is a `Meters` node.
	 * view.initialize({ meters: 5 });
	 * ```
	 *
	 * @privateRemarks
	 * In the future, we can support lossless round tripping via the canonical JSON-like representation above when unambiguous.
	 * This could be done via methods added to `Tree` to export and import such objects, which would give us a place to explicitly define the type of this representation.
	 *
	 * To make this more permissive in the future we can:
	 *
	 * - Make toMapTree more permissive (ex: allow disambiguation based on leaf type)
	 * - Update this check to more tightly match toMapTree
	 * - Add options to help schema authors disambiguate their types, such as "constant fields" which are not persisted, and always have a constant value.
	 *
	 * The above examples exist in executable form in this files tests, and should be updated there then copied back here.
