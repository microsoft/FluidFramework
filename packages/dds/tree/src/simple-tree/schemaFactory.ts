/**
 * Creates various types of {@link TreeNodeSchema|schema} for {@link TreeNode}s.
 *
 * @typeParam TScope - Scope added as a prefix to the name of every schema produced by this factory.
 * @typeParam TName - Type of names used to identify each schema produced in this factory.
 * Typically this is just `string` but it is also possible to use `string` or `number` based enums if you prefer to identify your types that way.
 *
 * @remarks
 * All schema produced by this factory get a {@link TreeNodeSchemaCore.identifier|unique identifier} by combining the {@link SchemaFactory.scope} with the schema's `Name`.
 * The `Name` part may be explicitly provided as a parameter, or inferred as a structural combination of the provided types.
 * The APIs which use this second approach, structural naming, also deduplicate all equivalent calls.
 * Therefor two calls to `array(allowedTypes)` with the same allowedTypes will return the same {@link TreeNodeSchema} instance.
 * On the other hand, two calls to `array(name, allowedTypes)` will always return different {@link TreeNodeSchema} instances
 * and it is an error to use both in the same tree (since their identifiers are not unique).
 *
 * Note:
 * POJO stands for Plain Old JavaScript Object.
 * This means an object that works like a `{}` style object literal.
 * In this case it means the prototype is `Object.prototype` and acts like a set of key value pairs (data, not methods).
 * The usage below generalizes this to include array and map like objects as well.
 *
 * There are two ways to use these APIs:
 * |                     | Customizable | POJO Emulation |
 * | ------------------- | ------------ |--------------- |
 * | Declaration         | `class X extends schemaFactory.object("x", {}) {}` | `const X = schemaFactory.object("x", {}); type X = NodeFromSchema<typeof X>; `
 * | Allows adding "local" (non-persisted) members | Yes. Members (including methods) can be added to class.        | No. Attempting to set non-field members will error. |
 * | Prototype | The user defined class | `Object.prototype`, `Map.prototype` or `Array.prototype` depending on node kind |
 * | Structurally named Schema | Not Supported | Supported |
 * | Explicitly named Objects | Supported | Supported |
 * | Explicitly named Maps and Arrays | Supported: Both declaration approaches can be used | Not Supported |
 * | node.js assert.deepEqual | Compares like class instances: equal to other nodes of the same type with the same content, including custom local fields. | Compares like plain objects: equal to plain JavaScript objects with the same fields, and other nodes with the same fields, even if the types are different. |
 * | IntelliSense | Shows and links to user defined class by name: `X` | Shows internal type generation logic: `object & TreeNode & ObjectFromSchemaRecord<{}> & WithType<"test.x">` |
 * | Recursion | Supported with special declaration patterns. | Unsupported: Generated d.ts files replace recursive references with `any`, breaking use of recursive schema across compilation boundaries |
 *
 * Note that while "POJO Emulation" nodes act a lot like POJO objects, they are not true POJO objects:
 *
 * - Adding new arbitrary fields will error, as well some cases of invalid edits.
 *
 * - They are implemented using proxies.
 *
 * - They have state that is not exposed via enumerable own properties, including a {@link TreeNodeSchema}.
 * This makes libraries like node.js `assert.deepEqual` fail to detect differences in type.
 *
 * - Assigning members has side effects (in this case editing the persisted/shared tree).
 *
 * - Not all operations implied by the prototype will work correctly: stick to the APIs explicitly declared in the TypeScript types.
 *
 * @privateRemarks
 * It's perfectly possible to make `POJO Emulation` mode (or even just hiding the prototype) selectable even when using the custom user class declaration syntax.
 * When doing this, it's still possible to make `instanceof` perform correctly.
 * Allowing (or banning) custom/out-of-schema properties on the class is also possible in both modes: it could be orthogonal.
 * Also for consistency, if keeping the current approach to detecting `POJO Emulation` mode it might make sense to make explicitly named Maps and Arrays do the detection the same as how object does it.
