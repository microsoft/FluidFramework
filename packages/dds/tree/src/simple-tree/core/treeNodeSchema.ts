/**
 * Tree node schema which is implemented using a class.
 * @remarks
 * Instances of this class are nodes in the tree.
 * This is also a constructor so that it can be subclassed.
 *
 * Using classes in this way allows introducing a named type and a named value at the same time, helping keep the runtime and compile time information together and easy to refer to un a uniform way.
 * Additionally, this works around https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/55832 which causes similar patterns with less explicit types to infer "any" in the d.ts file.
 *
 * When sub-classing a a `TreeNodeSchemaClass`, some extra rules must be followed:
 *
 * - Only ever use a single class from the schema's class hierarchy within a document and its schema.
 * For example, if using {@link SchemaFactory.object} you can do:
 * ```typescript
 * // Recommended "customizable" object schema pattern.
 * class Good extends schemaFactory.object("A", {
 * 	exampleField: schemaFactory.number,
 * }) {
 * 	public exampleCustomMethod(): void {
 * 		this.exampleField++;
 * 	}
 * }
 * ```
 * But should avoid:
 * ```typescript
 * // This by itself is ok, and opts into "POJO mode".
 * const base = schemaFactory.object("A", {});
 * // This is a bad pattern since it leaves two classes in scope which derive from the same SchemaFactory defined class.
 * // If both get used, its an error!
 * class Invalid extends base {}
 * ```
 * - Do not modify the constructor input parameter types or values:
 * ```typescript
 * class Invalid extends schemaFactory.object("A", {
 * 	exampleField: schemaFactory.number,
 * }) {
 * 	// This Modifies the type of the constructor input.
 * 	// This is unsupported due to programmatic access to the constructor being used internally.
 * 	public constructor(a: number) {
 * 		super({ exampleField: a });
 * 	}
 * }
 * ```
