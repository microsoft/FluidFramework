/**
 * Schema for types allowed in some location in a tree (like a field, map entry or array).
 * @remarks
 * Type constraint used in schema declaration APIs.
 *
 * The order of types in the array is not significant.
 * Additionally, it is legal for users of this type to have the runtime and compile time order of items within this array not match.
 * Therefor to ensure type safety, these arrays should not be indexed, and instead just be iterated.
 *
 * Ideally this restriction would be modeled in the type itself, but it is not ergonomic to do so as there is no easy (when compared to arrays)
 * way to declare and manipulate unordered sets of types in TypeScript.
 *
 * Duplicate entries in this array are not allowed and will produce runtime errors.
 * Duplicate types are allowed,
 * but this must only be reflected in the type and not the runtime values.
 * This duplication can be used to encode the typing when the number of items in the array is not known at compile time
 * but some of the items are known to be present unconditionally.
 * For example, typing `[typeof A] | [typeof A, typeof B]` as `[typeof A, typeof B | typeof A]` is allowed,
 * and can produce more useful {@link Input} types.
 * @privateRemarks
 * Code reading data from this should use `normalizeAllowedTypes` to ensure consistent handling, caching, nice errors etc.

/**
 * This type exists only to be linked from documentation to provide a single linkable place to document some details of
 * "Input" types and how they handle schema.
 *
 * When a schema is used to describe data which is an input into an API, the API is [contravariant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covariance_and_contravariance_(computer_science)) over the schema.
 * (See also, [TypeScript Variance Annotations](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/generics.html#variance-annotations)).
 *
 * Since these schema are expressed using TypeScript types, it is possible for the user of the API to provide non-exact values of these types which has implications that depended on the variance.
 *
 * Consider a field with schema type of `A | B` (where A and B are types of schema).
 *
 * - Reading the field behaves covariantly so {@link NodeFromSchema} of `<A | B>` is the same as `NodeFromSchema<A> | NodeFromSchema<B>`, indicating that either type of node can be read from the field.
 *
 * - Writing to the field behaves contravariantly. Since it is unknown if the node actually has a schema `A` or a schema `B`, the only legal values (known to be in schema regardless of which schema the underlying node has) are values which are legal for both `A & B`.
 *
 * Note that this is distinct from the case where the schema is `[A, B]`.
 * In this case it is known that the field allows both A and B (the field can be set to an A or a B value).
 * When `A | B` is used, the field might allow
 * A but not B (so assigning a B value would be out of schema),
 * B but not A (so assigning an A value would be out of schema)
 * or both A and B.
 *
 * This gets more extreme when given completely unspecified schema.
 * For example if a field is just provided {@link ImplicitFieldSchema}, nothing is known about the content of the field.
 * This means that reading the field (via {@link TreeFieldFromImplicitField}) can give any valid tree field content,
 * but there are no safe values which could be written to the field (since it is unknown what values would be out of schema) so {@link InsertableTreeFieldFromImplicitField} gives `never`.
 *
 * To implement this variance correctly, the computation of types for input and output have to use separate utilities
 * which take very different approaches when encountering non-exact schema like unions or `ImplicitFieldSchema`.
 * The utilities which behave contravariantly (as required to handle input correctly) link this documentation to indicate that this is how they behave.
 *
 * In addition to behaving contravariantly, these input type computation utilities often have further limitations.
 * This is due to TypeScript making it difficult to implement this contravariance exactly.
 * When faced with these implementation limitations these contravariant type computation utilities error on the side of producing overly strict requirements.
 * For example in the above case of `A | B`, the utilities might compute an allowed insertable type as `never` even if there happens to be a common value accepted by both `A` and `B`.
 * Future versions of the API can relax these requirements as the type computations are made more accurate.
 *
 * For a more concrete example: if {@link InsertableTreeFieldFromImplicitField} produced `never` for a schema `A | OptionalField<A>`,
 * a future version could instead return a more flexible but still safe type, like `A`.
 *
 * More generally: try to avoid providing non-exact schema, especially for the fields of other schema.
 * While these APIs attempt to handle such cases correctly, there are limitations and known bugs in this handling.
 * Code using non-exact schema is much more likely to have its compilation break due to updates of this package or even TypeScript,
 * and thus compilation breaks due to edge cases of non-exact schema handling, especially with recursive schema, are not considered breaking changes.
 * This may change as the API become more stable.
 *
 * @privateRemarks
 * There likely is a better way to share this documentation, but none was found at the time of writing.
