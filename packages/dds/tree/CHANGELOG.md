# @fluidframework/tree

## 2.4.0

### Minor Changes

-   ✨ New! Alpha API for providing SharedTree configuration options ([#22701](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/pull/22701)) [40d3648ddf](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/40d3648ddfb5223ef6daef49a4f5cab1cfa52b71)

    A new alpha `configuredSharedTree` had been added.
    This allows providing configuration options, primarily for debugging, testing and evaluation of upcoming features.
    The resulting configured `SharedTree` object can then be used in-place of the regular `SharedTree` imported from `fluid-framework`.

    ```typescript
    import {
    	ForestType,
    	TreeCompressionStrategy,
    	configuredSharedTree,
    	typeboxValidator,
    } from "@fluid-framework/alpha";
    // Maximum debuggability and validation enabled:
    const SharedTree = configuredSharedTree({
    	forest: ForestType.Expensive,
    	jsonValidator: typeboxValidator,
    	treeEncodeType: TreeCompressionStrategy.Uncompressed,
    });
    // Opts into the under development optimized tree storage planned to be the eventual default implementation:
    const SharedTree = configuredSharedTree({
    	forest: ForestType.Optimized,
    });
    ```

-   ✨ New! Alpha API for snapshotting Schema ([#22733](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/pull/22733)) [920a65f66e](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/920a65f66e0caad7e1b5e3df1e0afd3475a87c4a)

    `extractPersistedSchema` can now be used to extra a JSON-compatible representation of the subset of a schema that gets stored in documents.
    This can be used write tests which snapshot an applications schema.
    Such tests can be used to detect schema changes which could would impact document compatibility,
    and can be combined with the new `comparePersistedSchema` to measure what kind of compatibility impact the schema change has.

-   Fix reading of `null` from unhydrated trees ([#22748](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/pull/22748)) [6a75bd0616](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/6a75bd0616ecd315ae0e9458d88ba1c755dfd785)

    Unhydrated trees containing object nodes with required fields set to `null` used to throw an error.
    This was a bug: `null` is a valid value in tree's whose schema allow it, and this specific case now correctly returns `null` values when appropriate without erroring.

-   Expose the view schema from the TreeView interface ([#22547](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/pull/22547)) [2aa29d9a13](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/2aa29d9a13f099b129ec6834c8cbdaf6a25db114)

    Users of TreeView can now access the type-safe view schema directly on the view object via `TreeView.schema`.
    This allows users to avoid passing the schema around in addition to the view in scenarios where both are needed.
    It also avoids scenarios in which code wants to accept both a view and its schema and thus must constrain both to be of the same schema type.

-   Metadata can now be associated with Field Schema ([#22564](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/pull/22564)) [1d9f4c97ed](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/1d9f4c97edf3f2bbf23ca30c35b67f0ec38b728d)

    Users of TreeView can now specify metadata when creating Field Schema.
    This includes system-understood metadata, i.e., `description`.

    Example:

    ```typescript
    class Point extends schemaFactory.object("Point", {
    	x: schemaFactory.required(schemaFactory.number, {
    		metadata: { description: "The horizontal component of the point." },
    	}),
    	y: schemaFactory.required(schemaFactory.number, {
    		metadata: { description: "The vertical component of the point." },
    	}),
    }) {}
    ```

    Functionality like the experimental conversion of Tree Schema to [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/) (`getJsonSchema`) can leverage such system-understood metadata to generate useful information.
    In the case of the `description` property, this is mapped directly to the `description` property supported by JSON Schema.

    Custom, user-defined properties can also be specified.
    These properties will not be leveraged by the system by default, but can be used as a handy means of associating common application-specific properties with Field Schema.

    Example:

    An application is implementing search functionality.
    By default, the app author wishes for all app content to be indexable by search, unless otherwise specified.
    They can leverage schema metadata to decorate fields that should be ignored by search, and leverage that information when walking the tree during a search.

    ```typescript

    interface AppMetadata {
    	/**
    	 * Whether or not the field should be ignored by search.
    	 * @defaultValue `false`
    	 */
    	searchIgnore?: boolean;
    }

    class Note extends schemaFactory.object("Note", {
    	position: schemaFactory.required(Point, {
    		metadata: {
    			description: "The position of the upper-left corner of the note."
    			custom: {
    				// Search doesn't care where the note is on the canvas.
    				// It only cares about the text content.
    				searchIgnore: true
    			}
    		}
    	}),
    	text: schemaFactory.required(schemaFactory.string, {
    		metadata: {
    			description: "The textual contents of the note."
    		}
    	}),
    }) {}

    ```

    Search can then be implemented to look for the appropriate metadata, and leverage it to omit the unwanted position data from search.

-   ✨ New! Alpha SharedTree branching APIs ([#22550](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/pull/22550)) [8f4587c912](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/8f4587c912f955c405d7bbbc5b42f3ffc3b497d7)

    Several APIs have been added to allow for creating and coordinating "version-control"-style branches of the SharedTree.
    Use the `getBranch` entry point function to acquire a branch.
    For example:

    ```ts
    function makeEditOnBranch(mainView: TreeView<typeof MySchema>) {
    	mainView.root.myData = 3;
    	const mainBranch = getBranch(mainView); // This function accepts either a view of a SharedTree (acquired e.g. via `sharedTree.viewWith(...)`) or a `SharedTree` directly.
    	const forkBranch = mainBranch.branch(); // This creates a new branch based on the existing branch.
    	const forkView = forkBranch.viewWith(new TreeViewConfiguration({ schema: MySchema })); // Acquire a view of the forked branch in order to read or edit its tree.
    	forkView.root.myData = 4; // Set the value on the fork branch to be 4. The main branch still has a value of 3.
    	mainBranch.merge(forkBranch); // Merging the fork changes into the main branch causes the main branch to have a value of 4.

    	// Note: The main branch (and therefore, also the `forkView`) is automatically disposed by the merge.
    	// To prevent this, use `mainBranch.merge(forkBranch, false)`.
    }
    ```

    Merging any number of commits into a target branch (via the `TreeBranch.merge` method) generates a revertible for each
    commit on the target branch. See [#22644](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/pull/22644) for more information
    about revertible support in the branching APIs.

-   Unhydrated SharedTree nodes now emit change events when edited ([#22661](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/pull/22661)) [d1eade6547](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/d1eade65477a4e7fb1f8062cb83dfa03a8b1d800)

    Newly-created SharedTree nodes which have not yet been inserted into the tree will now emit `nodeChanged` and `treeChanged` events when they are mutated via editing operations.

    ```ts
    const node = new Foo({ foo: 3 });
    Tree.on(node, "nodeChanged", () => {
    	console.log("This will fire even before node is inserted!");
    });

    node.foo = 4; // log: "This will fire even before node is inserted!";
    ```

-   SharedTree's `RestrictiveReadonlyRecord` is deprecated ([#22479](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/pull/22479)) [8be73d374d](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/8be73d374de04ff6226c531ba8b562561572640f)

    `RestrictiveReadonlyRecord` was an attempt to implement a version of TypeScript's built-in `Record<TKey, TValue>` type that would prohibit (instead of leaving unrestricted like Record does) values under keys that do not extend `TKey`.

    The implementation of `RestrictiveReadonlyRecord` failed to accomplish this except for the edge cases where `TKey` was exactly `string` or exactly `symbol`.
    Fixing this bug appears to be impossible within the current limitation of TypeScript, however this library does not require any case other than `TKey` being exactly `string`.

    To reduce the risk of users of the tree library using the problematic `RestrictiveReadonlyRecord` type, it has been deprecated and replaced with a more specific type that avoids the bug, `RestrictiveStringRecord<TValue>`.

    To highlight that this new type is not intended for direct use by users of tree, and instead is just used as part of the typing of its public API, `RestrictiveStringRecord` has been tagged with `@system`.
    See [API Support Levels](https://fluidframework.com/docs/build/releases-and-apitags/#api-support-levels) for more details.

-   Fix `.create` on structurally named MapNode and ArrayNode schema ([#22522](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/pull/22522)) [b3f91ae91c](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/b3f91ae91cb750a6a7696ab5ea17c00895bb6d92)

    Constructing a structurally named MapNode or ArrayNode schema (using the overload of `SchemaFactory.map` or `SchemaFactory.array` which does not take an explicit name), returned a `TreeNodeSchema` instead of a `TreeNodeSchemaNonClass`, which resulted in the `create` static method not being exposed.
    This has been fixed, and can now be used as follows:

    ```typescript
    const MyMap = schemaFactory.map(schemaFactory.number);
    type MyMap = NodeFromSchema<typeof MyMap>;
    const _fromMap: MyMap = MyMap.create(new MyMap());
    const _fromIterable: MyMap = MyMap.create([]);
    const _fromObject: MyMap = MyMap.create({});
    ```

    This change causes some types to reference `TreeNodeSchemaNonClass` which did not reference it before.
    While `TreeNodeSchemaNonClass` is `@system` (See [Fluid Releases and API Support Levels
    ](https://fluidframework.com/docs/build/releases-and-apitags/) for details) and thus not intended to be referred to by users of Fluid,
    this change caused the TypeScript compiler to generate references to it in more cases when compiling `d.ts` files.
    Since the TypeScript compiler is unable to generate references to `TreeNodeSchemaNonClass` with how it was nested in `internalTypes.js`,
    this change could break the build of packages exporting types referencing structurally named map and array schema.
    This has been mitigated by moving `TreeNodeSchemaNonClass` out of `internalTypes.js`:
    any code importing `TreeNodeSchemaNonClass` (and thus disregarding the `@system` restriction) can be fixed by importing it from the top level instead of the `internalTypes.js`

-   Non-leaf field access has been optimized ([#22717](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/pull/22717)) [6a2b68103c](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/6a2b68103cc3ad56a9ac0dfcaaa8546978ec29ac)

    When reading non-leaf children which have been read previously, they are retrieved from cache faster.
    Several operations on subtrees under arrays have been optimized, including reading of non-leaf nodes for the first time.
    Overall this showed a roughly 5% speed up in a read heavy test application (the BubbleBench example) but gains are expected to vary a lot based on use-case.

-   ✨ New! Alpha APIs for producing SharedTree schema from enums ([#20035](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/pull/20035)) [5f9bbe011a](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/5f9bbe011a18ccac08a70340f6d20e60ce30c4a4)

    `adaptEnum` and `enumFromStrings` have been added to `@fluidframework/tree/alpha` and `fluid-framework/alpha`.
    These unstable alpha APIs are relatively simple helpers on-top of public APIs (source: [schemaCreationUtilities.ts](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/blob/main/packages/dds/tree/src/simple-tree/schemaCreationUtilities.ts)):
    thus if these change or stable alternatives are needed, an application can replicate this functionality using these implementations as an example.

## 2.3.0

### Minor Changes

-   Add /alpha import path to @fluidframework/tree and fluid-framework packages ([#22483](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/pull/22483)) [12242cfdb5a](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/12242cfdb5aa4c342cc62f11cbf1c072840bec44)

    `@fluidframework/tree` and `fluid-framework` now have a `/alpha` import path where their `@alpha` APIs are exported.

-   Refactor code for emitting events to make it easier to copy into other projects ([#22275](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/pull/22275)) [49849bb5f6b](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/49849bb5f6bf92765bc63e19cdaf4f7d0498bebc)

    Factored event emitting utilities into their own file, `events/emitter.ts`.
    Applications wishing to use SharedTree's eventing library for custom events can copy this file (and its referenced utility function) as a starting point for defining and emitting their own custom events.
    See `createEmitter`'s documentation for example usage.

    Currently there are no published or officially supported versions of these utilities, but they are relatively simple, and can be copied and customized as needed.

-   Implicitly constructed object nodes now only consider own properties during validation ([#22453](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/pull/22453)) [27faa56f5ae](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/27faa56f5ae334e0b65fdd84c75764645e64f063)

    When determining if some given data is compatible with a particular ObjectNode schema, both inherited and own properties were considered.
    However, when constructing the node from this data, only own properties were used.
    This allowed input which provided required values in inherited fields to pass validation.
    When the node was constructed, it would lack these fields, and end up out of schema.
    This has been fixed: both validation and node construction now only consider own properties.

    This may cause some cases which previously exhibited data corruption to now throw a usage error reporting the data is incompatible.
    Such cases may need to copy data from the objects with inherited properties into new objects with own properties before constructing nodes from them.

-   A `@beta` version of `nodeChanged` which includes the list of properties has been added ([#22229](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/pull/22229)) [aae34dd9fe1](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/aae34dd9fe1aa6c153c26035f1486f4d8944c810)

    ```typescript
    const factory = new SchemaFactory("example");
    class Point2d extends factory.object("Point2d", {
    	x: factory.number,
    	y: factory.number,
    }) {}

    const point = new Point2d({ x: 0, y: 0 });

    TreeBeta.on(point, "nodeChanged", (data) => {
    	const changed: ReadonlySet<"x" | "y"> = data.changedProperties;
    	if (changed.has("x")) {
    		// ...
    	}
    });
    ```

    The payload of the `nodeChanged` event emitted by SharedTree's `TreeBeta` includes a `changedProperties` property that indicates
    which properties of the node changed.

    For object nodes, the list of properties uses the property identifiers defined in the schema, and not the persisted
    identifiers (or "stored keys") that can be provided through `FieldProps` when defining a schema.
    See the documentation for `FieldProps` for more details about the distinction between "property keys" and "stored keys".

    For map nodes, every key that was added, removed, or updated by a change to the tree is included in the list of properties.

    For array nodes, the set of properties will always be undefined: there is currently no API to get details about changes to an array.

    Object nodes revieve strongly types sets of changed keys, allowing compile time detection of incorrect keys:

    ```typescript
    TreeBeta.on(point, "nodeChanged", (data) => {
    	// @ts-expect-error Strong typing for changed properties of object nodes detects incorrect keys:
    	if (data.changedProperties.has("z")) {
    		// ...
    	}
    });
    ```

    The existing stable "nodeChanged" event's callback now is given a parameter called `unstable` of type `unknown` which is used to indicate that additional data can be provided there.
    This could break existing code using "nodeChanged" in a particularly fragile way.

    ```typescript
    function f(optional?: number) {
    	// ...
    }
    Tree.on(point, "nodeChanged", f); // Bad
    ```

    Code like this which is implicitly discarding an optional argument from the function used as the listener will be broken.
    It can be fixed by using an inline lambda expression:

    ```typescript
    function f(optional?: number) {
    	// ...
    }
    Tree.on(point, "nodeChanged", () => f()); // Safe
    ```

-   Make SharedTree usable with legacy APIs ([#22320](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/pull/22320)) [bbdf869b8a1](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/bbdf869b8a1aae266bc8cb6f6016dcd8c22f0f88)

    SharedTree was not previously exported in a way that made it usable with @fluidframework/aqueduct or other lower-level legacy APIs. This fixes that issue by making it consistent with other DDSes: such usages can `import { SharedTree } from "@fluidframework/tree/legacy";`.

## 2.2.0

### Minor Changes

-   Compile-time type narrowing based on a TreeNode's NodeKind ([#22222](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/pull/22222)) [4d3bc876ae](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/4d3bc876ae32fa3f2568299e29246f6970e48ee0)

    `TreeNode`'s schema-aware APIs implement `WithType`, which now has a `NodeKind` parameter that can be used to narrow `TreeNode`s based on `NodeKind`.

    Example:

    ```typescript
    function getKeys(node: TreeNode & WithType<string, NodeKind.Array>): number[];
    function getKeys(node: TreeNode & WithType<string, NodeKind.Map | NodeKind.Object>): string[];
    function getKeys(node: TreeNode): string[] | number[];
    function getKeys(node: TreeNode): string[] | number[] {
    	const schema = Tree.schema(node);
    	switch (schema.kind) {
    		case NodeKind.Array: {
    			const arrayNode = node as TreeArrayNode;
    			const keys: number[] = [];
    			for (let index = 0; index < arrayNode.length; index++) {
    				keys.push(index);
    			}
    			return keys;
    		}
    		case NodeKind.Map:
    			return [...(node as TreeMapNode).keys()];
    		case NodeKind.Object:
    			return Object.keys(node);
    		default:
    			throw new Error("Unsupported Kind");
    	}
    }
    ```

-   ✨ New! `Record`-typed objects can now be used to construct MapNodes ([#22042](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/pull/22042)) [25deff344b](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/25deff344b447380486c1efb64ed69177c32ddc5)

    You can now construct MapNodes from `Record` typed objects, similar to how maps are expressed in JSON.

    Before this change, an `Iterable<string, Child>` was required, but now an object like `{key1: Child1, key2: Child2}` is allowed.

    Full example using this new API:

    ```typescript
    class Schema extends schemaFactory.map("ExampleMap", schemaFactory.number) {}
    const fromRecord = new Schema({ x: 5 });
    ```

    This new feature makes it possible for schemas to construct a tree entirely from JSON-compatible objects using their constructors,
    as long as they do not require unhydrated nodes to differentiate ambiguous unions,
    or IFluidHandles (which themselves are not JSON compatible).

    Due to limitations of TypeScript and recursive types,
    recursive maps do not advertise support for this feature in their typing,
    but it works at runtime.

-   New SharedTree configuration option: `ITreeConfigurationOptions.preventAmbiguity` ([#22048](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/pull/22048)) [966906a034](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/966906a03490daa5a914030b37342abb8267c12d)

    The new `ITreeConfigurationOptions.preventAmbiguity` flag can be set to true to enable checking of some additional rules when constructing the `TreeViewConfiguration`.

    This example shows an ambiguous schema:

    ```typescript
    const schemaFactory = new SchemaFactory("com.example");
    class Feet extends schemaFactory.object("Feet", { length: schemaFactory.number }) {}
    class Meters extends schemaFactory.object("Meters", { length: schemaFactory.number }) {}
    const config = new TreeViewConfiguration({
    	// This combination of schema can lead to ambiguous cases, and will error since preventAmbiguity is true.
    	schema: [Feet, Meters],
    	preventAmbiguity: true,
    });
    const view = tree.viewWith(config);
    // This is invalid since it is ambiguous which type of node is being constructed.
    // The error thrown above when constructing the TreeViewConfiguration is because of this ambiguous case:
    view.initialize({ length: 5 });
    ```

    See the documentation on `ITreeConfigurationOptions.preventAmbiguity` for a more complete example and more details.

-   `Tree.schema` now returns `TreeNodeSchema` ([#22185](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/pull/22185)) [bfe8310a94](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/bfe8310a9406a8658c2fac8827c7114844c32234)

    The typing of `Tree.schema` has changed from:

    ```typescript
    schema<T extends TreeNode | TreeLeafValue>(node: T): TreeNodeSchema<string, NodeKind, unknown, T>;
    ```

    to:

    ```typescript
    schema(node: TreeNode | TreeLeafValue): TreeNodeSchema;
    ```

    The runtime behavior is unaffected: any code which worked and still compiles is fine and does not need changes.

    `Tree.schema` was changed to mitigate two different issues:

    1. It tried to give a more specific type based on the type of the passed in value.
       When the type of the input is not known precisely (for example it is a union of node types like `Foo | Bar`, or `TreeNode` or even `TreeNode | TreeLeafValue`), this was fine since schema are covariant over their node type.
       However when the input was more specific that the schema type, for example the type is simply `0`, this would result in unsound typing, since the create function could actually return values that did not conform with that schema (for example `schema.create(1)` for the number schema typed with `0` would return `1` with type `0`).
    2. The node type was provided to the incorrect type parameter of TreeNodeSchema.
       The `TNode` parameter is the third one, not the fourth.
       The fourth is `TBuild` which sets the input accepted to its create function or constructor.
       Thus this code accidentally left `TNode` unset (which is good due to the above issue), but invalidly set `TBuild`.
       `TBuild` is contravariant, so it has the opposite issue that setting `TNode` would have: if your input is simply typed as something general like `TreeNode`, then the returned schema would claim to be able to construct an instance given any `TreeNode`.
       This is incorrect, and this typing has been removed.

    Fortunately it should be rare for code to be impacted by this issue.
    Any code which manually specified a generic type parameter to `Tree.schema()` will break, as well as code which assigned its result to an overly specifically typed variable.
    Code which used `typeof` on the returned schema could also break, though there are few use-cases for this so such code is not expected to exist.
    Currently it's very difficult to invoke the create function or constructor associated with a `TreeNodeSchema` as doing so already requires narrowing to `TreeNodeSchemaClass` or `TreeNodeSchemaNonClass`.
    It is possible some such code exists which will need to have an explicit cast added because it happened to work with the more specific (but incorrect) constructor input type.

-   Recursive SharedTree schemas using MapNodes no longer produce invalid d.ts files ([#22106](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/pull/22106)) [554fc5a94e](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/554fc5a94e57e2d109ea9008b7c64517c58a6b73)

    Consider a recursive SharedTree schema like the following, which follows all our recommended best practices:

    ```typescript
    export class RecursiveMap extends schema.mapRecursive("RM", [() => RecursiveMap]) {}
    {
    	type _check = ValidateRecursiveSchema<typeof RecursiveMap>;
    }
    ```

    This schema would work when used from within its compilation unit, but would generate d.ts that fails to compile when exporting it:

    ```typescript
    declare const RecursiveMap_base: import("@fluidframework/tree").TreeNodeSchemaClass<
    	"com.example.RM",
    	import("@fluidframework/tree").NodeKind.Map,
    	import("@fluidframework/tree").TreeMapNodeUnsafe<readonly [() => typeof RecursiveMap]> &
    		import("@fluidframework/tree").WithType<"com.example.RM">,
    	{
    		[Symbol.iterator](): Iterator<[string, RecursiveMap], any, undefined>;
    	},
    	false,
    	readonly [() => typeof RecursiveMap]
    >;
    export declare class RecursiveMap extends RecursiveMap_base {}
    ```

    This results in the compile error in TypeScript 5.4.5:

    > error TS2310: Type 'RecursiveMap' recursively references itself as a base type.

    With this change, that error is fixed by modifying the `TreeMapNodeUnsafe` type it references to inline the definition of `ReadonlyMap` instead of using the one from the TypeScript standard library.

-   ✨ New! When unambiguous, ArrayNodes can now be constructed from Maps and MapNodes from arrays ([#22036](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/pull/22036)) [25e74f9f3b](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/25e74f9f3bed6e6ff041c088813c4cc1ea276b9c)

    Since the types for ArrayNodes and MapNodes indicate they can be constructed from iterables,
    it should work, even if those iterables are themselves arrays or maps.
    To avoid this being a breaking change, a priority system was introduced.
    ArrayNodes will only be implicitly constructable from JavaScript Map objects in contexts where no MapNodes are allowed.
    Similarly MapNodes will only be implicitly constructable from JavaScript Array objects in contexts where no ArrayNodes are allowed.

    In practice, the main case in which this is likely to matter is when implicitly constructing a map node. If you provide an array of key value pairs, this now works instead of erroring, as long as no ArrayNode is valid at that location in the tree.

    ```typescript
    class MyMapNode extends schemaFactory.map("x", schemaFactory.number) {}
    class Root extends schemaFactory.object("root", { data: MyMapNode }) {}
    // This now works (before it compiled, but error at runtime):
    const fromArray = new Root({ data: [["x", 5]] });
    ```

    Prior versions used to have to do:

    ```typescript
    new Root({ data: new MyMapNode([["x", 5]]) });
    ```

    or:

    ```typescript
    new Root({ data: new Map([["x", 5]]) });
    ```

    Both of these options still work: strictly more cases are allowed with this change.

-   Implicit TreeNode construction improvements ([#21995](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/pull/21995)) [977f96c1a0](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/977f96c1a0dd1d5eb0dbcd087d07cb7510d533ea)

    ArrayNodes and MapNodes could always be explicitly constructed (using `new`) from iterables.
    The types also allowed using of iterables to implicitly construct array nodes and map nodes,
    but this did not work at runtime.
    This has been fixed for all cases except implicitly constructing an ArrayNode form an `Iterable` that is actually a `Map`,
    and implicitly constructing a MapNode from an `Iterable` that is actually an `Array`.
    These cases may be fixed in the future, but require additional work to ensure unions of array nodes and map nodes work correctly.

    Additionally MapNodes can now be constructed from `Iterator<readonly [string, content]>` where previously the inner arrays had to be mutable.

-   Support generation of JSON Schema from Shared Tree view schema (alpha) ([#21984](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/pull/21984)) [9097bf8a44](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/9097bf8a44310d0dcf1a4d2efc3a6f75997c58b3)

    > [!WARNING]
    > This API is [alpha quality](https://fluidframework.com/docs/build/releases-and-apitags/#api-support-levels) and may change at any time.

    Adds alpha-quality support for canonical [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/docs) representation of Shared Tree schema and adds a `getJsonSchema` function for getting that representation for a given `TreeNodeSchema`.
    This JSON Schema representation can be used to describe schema requirements to external systems, and can be used with validation tools like [ajv](https://ajv.js.org/) to validate data before inserting it into a `SharedTree`.

    #### Example

    Given a `SharedTree` schema like the following:

    ```typescript
    class MyObject extends schemaFactory.object("MyObject", {
    	foo: schemaFactory.number,
    	bar: schemaFactory.optional(schemaFactory.string),
    });
    ```

    JSON Schema like the following would be produced:

    ```json
    {
    	"$defs": {
    		"com.fluidframework.leaf.string": {
    			"type": "string"
    		},
    		"com.fluidframework.leaf.number": {
    			"type": "number"
    		},
    		"com.myapp.MyObject": {
    			"type": "object",
    			"properties": {
    				"foo": { "$ref": "com.fluidframework.leaf.number" },
    				"bar": { "$ref": "com.fluidframework.leaf.string" }
    			},
    			"required": ["foo"]
    		}
    	},
    	"anyOf": [{ "$ref": "#/$defs/com.myapp.MyObject" }]
    }
    ```

-   Enforce use of TreeViewConfiguration's constructor ([#22055](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/pull/22055)) [e8955579f6](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/e8955579f6d52a6c7e300642088c60d6ed12d7db)

    `TreeViewConfiguration` is `@sealed`, meaning creating custom implementations of it such as assigning object literals to a `TreeViewConfiguration` or sub-classing it are not supported.
    This reserved the ability for the Fluid Framework to add members to this class over time, informing users that they must use it in such a way where such changes are non-breaking.
    However, there was no compiler-based enforcement of this expectation.
    It was only indicated via documentation and an implicit assumption that when an API takes in a typed defined as a class, that an instance of that class must be used rather than an arbitrary object of a similar shape.

    With this change, the TypeScript compiler will now inform users when they invalidly provide an object literal as a `TreeViewConfiguration`.

    More specifically this causes code like this to produce a compile error:

    ```typescript
    // Don't do this!
    const view = tree.viewWith({ schema: TestNode, enableSchemaValidation: false });
    ```

    The above was never intended to work, and is not a supported use of the `viewWith` since it requires a `TreeViewConfiguration` which is sealed.
    Any code using the above pattern will break in Fluid Framework 2.2 and above. Such code will need to be updated to the pattern shown below.
    Any code broken by this change is technically unsupported and only worked due to a gap in the type checking. This is not considered a breaking change.
    The correct way to get a `TreeViewConfiguration` is by using its constructor:

    ```typescript
    // This pattern correctly initializes default values and validates input.
    const view = tree.viewWith(new TreeViewConfiguration({ schema: TestNode }));
    ```

    Skipping the constructor causes the following problems:

    1. `TreeViewConfiguration` does validation in its constructor, so skipping it also skips the validation which leads to much less friendly error messages for invalid schema.
    2. Skipping the constructor also discards any default values for options like `enableSchemaValidation`.
       This means that code written in that style would break if more options were added. Since such changes are planned,
       it is not practical to support this pattern.

-   Add a function `isRepoSuperset` to determine if changes to a document schema are backward-compatible ([#22045](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/pull/22045)) [f6fdc95bb3](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/f6fdc95bb36a892710bc315aae85fd2c75aec975)

    Note: These changes are not customer-facing and make progress toward future plans in Tree's schema evolution space.

-   Add `@alpha` API `FixRecursiveArraySchema` as a workaround around an issue with recursive ArrayNode schema ([#22122](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/pull/22122)) [9ceacf9b54](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/9ceacf9b5468ac8280a1dc48ada9d8b46b499f14)

    Importing a recursive ArrayNode schema via a d.ts file can produce an error like
    `error TS2310: Type 'RecursiveArray' recursively references itself as a base type.`
    if using a tsconfig with `"skipLibCheck": false`.

    This error occurs due to the TypeScript compiler splitting the class definition into two separate declarations in the d.ts file (one for the base, and one for the actual class).
    For unknown reasons, splitting the class declaration in this way breaks the recursive type handling, leading to the mentioned error.

    Since recursive type handling in TypeScript is order dependent, putting just the right kind of usages of the type before the declarations can cause it to not hit this error.
    For the case of ArrayNodes, this can be done via usage that looks like this:

    ```typescript
    /**
     * Workaround to avoid
     * `error TS2310: Type 'RecursiveArray' recursively references itself as a base type.` in the d.ts file.
     */
    export declare const _RecursiveArrayWorkaround: FixRecursiveArraySchema<typeof RecursiveArray>;
    export class RecursiveArray extends schema.arrayRecursive("RA", [() => RecursiveArray]) {}
    {
    	type _check = ValidateRecursiveSchema<typeof RecursiveArray>;
    }
    ```

-   Fix document-corrupting bug when rebasing over move compositions ([#21993](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/pull/21993)) [f3af9d1cd3](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/f3af9d1cd3f7ee1ea3660ae934ddca8473fbdb9b)

    Before this fix, if multiple users concurrently performed moves (possibly by reverting prior moves), there was a chance that the document would become corrupted.

## 2.1.0

### Minor Changes

-   Detect arrayNode iterator invalidation ([#21760](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/pull/21760)) [6fd320c385](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/6fd320c38561e272a1acaf4248f47fc386c650e4)

    When `arrayNode`s are edited concurrently during iteration, an error will be thrown.

-   tree: Improved performance for accessing identifiers in shortId API ([#21944](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/pull/21944)) [6b4cf26d9c](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/6b4cf26d9cc14c1a36cf07fd7408f1d1227e373a)

    Users should see improved performance when calling the `Tree.shortId` API. Identifier field keys are now cached in the schema for faster access.

-   ✨ New! Debug visualizers for TreeNodes in NodeJS and browsers ([#21895](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/pull/21895)) [0d197fefec](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/0d197fefec852df2911151217ac1b71cde528a70)

    TreeNodes now have custom debug visualizers to improve the debug experience in NodeJS and in browsers. Note that custom formatters must be enabled in the browser developer tools for that visualizer to be used.

-   Using "delete" on tree fields now throws an error instead of not working correctly ([#21609](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/pull/21609)) [416849b1fd](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/416849b1fda029870ee1c1742100de4f8dde45b7)

    TypeScript allows `delete` on object node optional fields if the `exactOptionalPropertyTypes` tsconfig setting is not
    enabled. This does not work correctly at runtime and now produces an informative error.

-   SharedTree content that is removed is now deleted ([#21372](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/pull/21372)) [a6e412159a](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/a6e412159a4df6aceb84aac35288b108a5351905)

    SharedTree now supports garbage collection so that removed content is not retained forever.
    This is an internal change and users of SharedTree won't need to adapt any existing code.

    This change could cause errors with cross-version collaboration where an older client does not send data that a newer
    version may need. In this case, a "refresher data not found" error will be thrown.

-   Improved error reporting ([#21940](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/pull/21940)) [3b8a366dd1](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/3b8a366dd15660f9c916832040faf772534c0755)

    Several cases of invalid usage patterns for tree APIs have gained improved error reporting, as well as improved documentation on the APIs detailing what usage is supported.
    These improvements include:

    -   Unsupported usages of schema classes: using more than one schema class derived from a single SchemaFactory generated base class. This used to hit internal asserts, but now has a descriptive user-facing UsageError. Most of this work was done in [9fb3dcf](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/9fb3dcf491a7f0d66f4abbdc64ab97ccabef4707).
    -   Improved detection of when prior exception may have left SharedTree in an invalid state.
        These cases now report a UsageError including a reference to the prior exception. This was mainly done in [9fb3dcf](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/9fb3dcf491a7f0d66f4abbdc64ab97ccabef4707) and [b77d530](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/b77d530b9252201c40a90d1a2a6315f76f1a4a4b).

## 2.0.0-rc.5.0.0

### Minor Changes

-   fluid-framework: Type Erase ISharedObjectKind ([#21081](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/pull/21081)) [78f228e370](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/78f228e37055bd4d9a8f02b3a1eefebf4da9c59c)

    A new type, `SharedObjectKind` is added as a type erased version of `ISharedObjectKind` and `DataObjectClass`.

    This type fills the role of both `ISharedObjectKind` and `DataObjectClass` in the `@public` "declarative API" exposed in the `fluid-framework` package.

    This allows several types referenced by `ISharedObjectKind` to be made `@alpha` as they should only need to be used by legacy code and users of the unstable/alpha/legacy "encapsulated API".

    Access to these now less public types should not be required for users of the `@public` "declarative API" exposed in the `fluid-framework` package, but can still be accessed for those who need them under the `/legacy` import paths.
    The full list of such types is:

    -   `SharedTree` as exported from `@fluidframwork/tree`: It is still exported as `@public` from `fluid-framework` as `SharedObjectKind`.
    -   `ISharedObjectKind`: See new `SharedObjectKind` type for use in `@public` APIs.
        `ISharedObject`
    -   `IChannel`
    -   `IChannelAttributes`
    -   `IChannelFactory`
    -   `IExperimentalIncrementalSummaryContext`
    -   `IGarbageCollectionData`
    -   `ISummaryStats`
    -   `ISummaryTreeWithStats`
    -   `ITelemetryContext`
    -   `IDeltaManagerErased`
    -   `IFluidDataStoreRuntimeEvents`
    -   `IFluidHandleContext`
    -   `IProvideFluidHandleContext`

    Removed APIs:

    -   `DataObjectClass`: Usages replaced with `SharedObjectKind`.
    -   `LoadableObjectClass`: Replaced with `SharedObjectKind`.
    -   `LoadableObjectClassRecord`: Replaced with `Record<string, SharedObjectKind>`.
    -

-   tree: Added support for optional schema validation on newly inserted content in SharedTree ([#21011](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/pull/21011)) [b14e9fa607](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/b14e9fa607a8281f86d0cfac631e33ef12033e21)

    When defining how to view a SharedTree, an application can now specify that new content inserted into the tree should
    be subject to schema validation at the time it is inserted, so if it's not valid according to the stored schema in the
    tree an error is thrown immediately.

    This can be accomplished by passing an `ITreeConfigurationOptions` argument with `enableSchemaValidation` set to `true`
    when creating a `TreeConfiguration` to use with the SharedTree.

    Since this feature requires additional compute when inserting new content into the tree, it is not enabled by default.

-   Update to TypeScript 5.4 ([#21214](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/pull/21214)) [0e6256c722](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/0e6256c722d8bf024f4325bf02547daeeb18bfa6)

    Update package implementations to use TypeScript 5.4.5.

-   tree: A new tree status has been added for SharedTree nodes. ([#21270](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/pull/21270)) [8760e321b0](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/8760e321b02177babfb187ae293a17a65723f249)

    `TreeStatus.Created` indicates that a SharedTree node has been constructed but not yet inserted into the tree.
    Constraints passed to the `runTransaction` API are now marked as `readonly`.

-   tree: Adjusted Listenable multi-event subscription policy. ([#21244](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/pull/21244)) [a0c1d2c5b1](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/a0c1d2c5b1e20f3dc469377c093649fc5eb8c3dd)

    `Listenable.on()` no longer supports the same listener function object being registered twice for the same event.
    The deregister function returned by `Listenable.on()` may now be called multiple times with no effect.

-   Update to ES 2022 ([#21292](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/pull/21292)) [68921502f7](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/68921502f79b1833c4cd6d0fe339bfb126a712c7)

    Update tsconfig to target ES 2022.

-   tree: Event types have been renamed ([#21233](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/pull/21233)) [4d56fd1f99](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/4d56fd1f99a25f34c69d1aed2b60fbe156fc068f)

    -   `ISubscribable` is renamed to `Listenable`.
    -   `IsEvent` type helper is renamed to `IsListener`.
    -   `Events` is renamed to `Listeners`.

-   tree: Move several types into InternalTypes ([#21482](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/pull/21482)) [64d49dd362](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/64d49dd3629cefe6260a1d6223e58b10c2ac0cb6)

    The stable public API surface for Tree has been reduced.
    Several types have been moved into InternalTypes, indicating that they are not fully stable nor intended to be referenced by users of Tree.

    -   NodeBuilderData
    -   FieldHasDefault
    -   TreeNodeSchemaNonClass
    -   TreeArrayNodeBase
    -   ScopedSchemaName
    -   DefaultProvider
    -   typeNameSymbol
    -   InsertableObjectFromSchemaRecord
    -   ObjectFromSchemaRecord
    -   FieldHasDefaultUnsafe
    -   ObjectFromSchemaRecordUnsafe
    -   TreeObjectNodeUnsafe
    -   TreeFieldFromImplicitFieldUnsafe
    -   TreeNodeFromImplicitAllowedTypesUnsafe
    -   InsertableTreeNodeFromImplicitAllowedTypesUnsafe
    -   TreeArrayNodeUnsafe
    -   TreeMapNodeUnsafe
    -   InsertableObjectFromSchemaRecordUnsafe
    -   InsertableTreeFieldFromImplicitFieldUnsafe
    -   InsertableTypedNodeUnsafe
    -   NodeBuilderDataUnsafe
    -   NodeFromSchemaUnsafe
    -   FlexList
    -   TreeApi

    Additionally a few more types which could not be moved due to technically limitations have been documented that they should be treated similarly.

    -   TreeNodeApi
    -   TreeNodeSchemaCore
    -   All \*Unsafe type (use for construction of recursive schema).
    -   WithType
    -   AllowedTypes
    -   FieldSchemaUnsafe

    Also to reduce confusion `type` was renamed to `typeNameSymbol`, and is now only type exported. `Tree.is` should be used to get type information from `TreeNodes` instead.

-   tree: object node fields with statically known default values are now optional ([#21193](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/pull/21193)) [21eac41660](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/21eac41660944208bad42b156d7df05fe6dc6b97)

    Makes object node fields with statically known default values (i.e., `optional` and `identifier` fields) optional when creating trees, where they were previously required.

    Example:

    ```typescript
    class Foo extends schemaFactory.object("Foo", {
    	name: schemaFactory.string,
    	id: schemaFactory.identifier,
    	nickname: schemaFactory.optional(schemaFactory.string),
    }) {}

    // Before
    const foo = new Foo({
    	name: "Bar",
    	id: undefined, // Had to explicitly specify `undefined` to opt into default behavior
    	nickname: undefined, // Had to explicitly specify `undefined` for optional field
    });

    // After
    const foo = new Foo({
    	name: "Bar",
    	// Can omit `id` and `nickname` fields, as both have statically known defaults!
    });
    ```

-   tree: Breaking change: Removed the `"afterBatch"` event from `Treeview` ([#21406](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/pull/21406)) [69aceb88e5](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/69aceb88e525d7fb5c93aaa8328ce26a56e2d9cb)

    This event is no longer necessary.
    In the past, it provided a means for waiting for a batch of changes to finish applying to the tree before taking some action.
    However, the tree change events exposed via `Tree.on` wait for a batch to complete before firing, so the `"afterBatch"` event provides no additional guarantees.
    Listeners of this event who wish to respond to changes to the tree view can use `"rootChanged"` instead.

-   tree: Fix AfterBatch event ([#21162](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/pull/21162)) [cecd740a6c](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/cecd740a6cadc6d3cdafdba7e22312b3d756c780)

    `TreeViewEvents.afterBatch` is now triggered when appropriate instead of never firing.

-   tree: Breaking change: `TreeStatus.Created` is now `TreeStatus.New` ([#21278](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/pull/21278)) [5a26346a14](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/5a26346a145ed54d08cd5a9b4f1c9b177711bd7c)

    `TreeStatus.Created` has been renamed to `TreeStatus.New`.

-   tree: Implement compatibility-based schema evolution API ([#20815](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/pull/20815)) [64e5763b70](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/64e5763b70e269418fbb77f75dbd3c82b91b1aff)

    This change adjusts some top-level APIs for using SharedTree to better accommodate applications that need to change their schema.
    These changes enable forwards compatibility with future work to relax `SharedTree`'s restrictions around view schema and stored schema compatibility.
    That future work will enable more flexible policies around how applications can update their documents' schemas over time.

    Application authors are encouraged to develop a compatibility policy which they are comfortable with using the guidance in the
    "Schema Evolvability" section of `@fluidframework/tree`'s readme.

    To make the details of schema compatibilities that SharedTree supports more clear,
    `TreeView.error` has been functionally replaced with the `compatibility` property.
    Users desiring the previous strict behavior should use `view.compatibility.isEquivalent` at appropriate places in application logic.

    # `ITree.schematize` removal

    `ITree.schematize` (and its argument `TreeConfiguration`) has been removed. Instead, call `ITree.viewWith` and provide it a `TreeViewConfiguration`.
    Unlike `schematize`, `viewWith` does not implicitly initialize the document.
    As such, it doesn't take an `initialTree` property.
    Instead, applications should initialize their trees in document creation codepaths using the added `TreeView.initialize` API.

    ## Old

    As an example, something like the following code may have been used before for both the document create and document load codepaths:

    ```typescript
    // -- fluid-framework API for statically defined objects in container schema --
    const tree = container.initialObjects.myTree;
    const view = tree.schematize(new TreeConfiguration(Point, () => new Point({ x: 0, y: 0 })));

    // -- fluid-framework API for dynamically created objects --
    const tree = await container.create(SharedTree);
    const view = tree.schematize(new TreeConfiguration(Point, () => new Point({ x: 0, y: 0 })));
    ```

    When using the encapsulated API, creating a tree looks a bit different but the call to `schematize` is the same:

    ```typescript
    // -- encapsulated API --
    const tree = SharedTree.create(runtime, "foo");
    const view = tree.schematize(new TreeConfiguration(Point, () => new Point({ x: 0, y: 0 })));
    ```

    ## New

    After migrating this code away from `schematize` and onto `viewWith`, it would look like this on the create codepath:

    ```typescript
    const treeConfig = new TreeViewConfiguration({ schema: Point });

    // The following line reflects the first-party API (e.g. @fluidframework/aqueduct). If using the third-party API, obtaining
    // a SharedTree is unaffected by this changeset.
    const tree = SharedTree.create(runtime, "foo");
    const view = tree.viewWith(treeConfig);
    view.initialize(new Point({ x: 0, y: 0 }));
    ```

    and this on the load codepath:

    ```typescript
    // 'tree' would typically be obtained by retrieving it from a well-known location, e.g. within a `DataObject`'s
    // root directory or in `IFluidContainer.initialObjects`
    const view = tree.viewWith(treeConfig);
    ```

    Besides only making the initial tree required to specify in places that actually perform document initialization, this is beneficial for mutation semantics: `tree.viewWith` never modifies the state of the underlying tree.
    This means applications are free to attempt to view a document using multiple schemas (e.g. legacy versions of their document format) without worrying about altering the document state.

    If existing code used schematize in a context where it wasn't known whether the document needed to be initialized, you can leverage `TreeView.compatibility` like so:

    ```typescript
    const view = tree.viewWith(config);
    if (view.compatibility.canInitialize) {
    	view.initialize(initialTree);
    }
    ```

    # Separate `schemaChanged` event on `TreeView`

    The previous `rootChanged` event was called whenever the root was invalidated, which happens on changes to the document schema
    as well as changes to the root field (i.e. usage of `TreeView.root`'s setter on a local client, or acking such a change made by
    a remote client).

    There was no distinct `schemaChanged` event, meaning that any time the root changed,
    clients would have needed to check the `error` state on `TreeView` to see if the document's underlying schema had been changed.

    Now, the latter case of the document's underlying schema changing has been split off into a `schemaChanged` event, which will
    fire before `rootChanged`.
    This should allow applications to run slightly less compatibility logic to routine changes to the root field.

-   core-interfaces, tree: Unify `IDisposable` interfaces ([#21184](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/pull/21184)) [cfcb827851](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/cfcb827851ffc81486db6c718380150189fb95c5)

    Public APIs in `@fluidframework/tree` now use `IDisposable` from `@fluidframework/core-interfaces` replacing `disposeSymbol` with "dispose".

    `IDisposable` in `@fluidframework/core-interfaces` is now `@sealed` indicating that third parties should not implement it to reserve the ability for Fluid Framework to extend it to include `Symbol.dispose` as a future non-breaking change.

-   tree: Fix bug where reading tree during events could cause issues ([#21172](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/pull/21172)) [81a648a984](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/81a648a9843f7940df318b63258d864d1fa91bc1)

    Reading the tree inside of NodeChange and TreeChange events could corrupt internal memory structures leading to invalid data in subsequence reads as well as internal errors being thrown. This bug has been fixed.

## 2.0.0-rc.4.0.0

### Minor Changes

-   Deprecated members of IFluidHandle are split off into new IFluidHandleInternal interface [96872186d0](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/96872186d0d0f245c1fece7d19b3743e501679b6)

    Split IFluidHandle into two interfaces, `IFluidHandle` and `IFluidHandleInternal`.
    Code depending on the previously deprecated members of IFluidHandle can access them by using `toFluidHandleInternal` from `@fluidframework/runtime-utils/legacy`.

    External implementation of the `IFluidHandle` interface are not supported: this change makes the typing better convey this using the `ErasedType` pattern.
    Any existing and previously working, and now broken, external implementations of `IFluidHandle` should still work at runtime, but will need some unsafe type casts to compile.
    Such handle implementation may break in the future and thus should be replaced with use of handles produced by the Fluid Framework client packages.

-   Minor API fixes for "@fluidframework/tree" package. [96872186d0](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/96872186d0d0f245c1fece7d19b3743e501679b6)

    Changes constructor for `FieldSchema` from public to private. Users should call `makeFieldSchema` to create instance of `FieldSchema`.

## 2.0.0-rc.3.0.0

### Major Changes

-   Packages now use package.json "exports" and require modern module resolution [97d68aa06b](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/97d68aa06bd5c022ecb026655814aea222a062ae)

    Fluid Framework packages have been updated to use the [package.json "exports"
    field](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v18.x/api/packages.html#exports) to define explicit entry points for both
    TypeScript types and implementation code.

    This means that using Fluid Framework packages require the following TypeScript settings in tsconfig.json:

    -   `"moduleResolution": "Node16"` with `"module": "Node16"`
    -   `"moduleResolution": "Bundler"` with `"module": "ESNext"`

    We recommend using Node16/Node16 unless absolutely necessary. That will produce transpiled JavaScript that is suitable
    for use with modern versions of Node.js _and_ Bundlers.
    [See the TypeScript documentation](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#moduleResolution) for more information
    regarding the module and moduleResolution options.

    **Node10 moduleResolution is not supported; it does not support Fluid Framework's API structuring pattern that is used
    to distinguish stable APIs from those that are in development.**

### Minor Changes

-   Better events [97d68aa06b](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/97d68aa06bd5c022ecb026655814aea222a062ae)

    We have updated the Events to make it easier to create granular event listeners for single nodes and better support the
    undo/redo feature. SharedTree nodes now expose `nodeChanged` and `treeChanged` events that fire in response to changes
    in the node, and to changes in the subtree rooted at the node, respectively.

    This change was originally made in [#20286](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/pull/20286) ([ac1e773960](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/ac1e7739607551abb0dae7fa74dda56aec94b609)).

    [Read more about SharedTree Events at fluidframework.com](https://fluidframework.com/docs/data-structures/tree/#event-handling)

-   Recursive schemas [97d68aa06b](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/97d68aa06bd5c022ecb026655814aea222a062ae)

    Schemas are even more powerful now with the added support for recursive types, which allows you to define types that
    reference nodes of the same type in their subtree.

    Users of the beta APIs via `SchemaFactoryRecursive` can now find them on `SchemaFactory`.

    [Read more about Recursive Schema at fluidframework.com](https://fluidframework.com/docs/data-structures/tree/#recursive-schema)

-   Transactions [97d68aa06b](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/97d68aa06bd5c022ecb026655814aea222a062ae)

    You can group multiple changes such that they are applied atomically, and if they fail, they fail atomically. As a
    result of grouping changes in a transaction, you also get a single revertible object making it easier to undo and redo.

    [Read more about Transactions at fluidframework.com](https://fluidframework.com/docs/data-structures/tree/#transactions)

-   tree: Empty optional fields on object nodes now are undefined non-enumerable own properties instead of not a property at all. [97d68aa06b](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/97d68aa06bd5c022ecb026655814aea222a062ae)

    Empty optional fields on object nodes now are now undefined non-enumerable own properties.
    This improves behavior in cases where they shadow inherited members which no longer have types which differ from the runtime behavior.

-   tree: Allow root editing and make TreeView parameterized over schema. [97d68aa06b](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/97d68aa06bd5c022ecb026655814aea222a062ae)

    TreeView now is parameterized over the field schema instead of the root field type. This was needed to infer the correct input type when reassigning the root.
    Code providing an explicit type to TreeView, like `TreeView<Foo>` can usually be updated by replacing that with `TreeView<typeof Foo>`.

-   fluid-framework: Replace SharedObjectClass with new ISharedObjectKind type. [97d68aa06b](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/97d68aa06bd5c022ecb026655814aea222a062ae)

    The static objects used as SharedObjectClass now explicitly implement the new ISharedObjectKind type.
    SharedObjectClass has been removed as ISharedObjectKind now fills that role.
    LoadableObjectCtor has been inlined as it only had one use: an external user of it can replace it with `(new (...args: any[]) => T)`.

-   Undo/Redo [97d68aa06b](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/97d68aa06bd5c022ecb026655814aea222a062ae)

    Added the ability to listen for changes and track revertible objects on your undo/redo stacks. Revertibles allow you to
    undo and redo changes even if other changes have been made in remote clients.

    [Read more about Undo/redo at fluidframework.com](https://fluidframework.com/docs/data-structures/tree/#undoredo-support)

## 2.0.0-rc.2.0.0

### Minor Changes

-   map, tree: DDS classes are no longer publicly exported ([#19717](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/issues/19717)) [ae1d0be26d](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/ae1d0be26d61453cff316b3f622a9f3647149167)

    SharedMap and SharedTree now only export their factories and the interface types.
    The actual concrete classes which leak implementation details are no longer exported.
    Users of the `SharedMap` type should use `ISharedMap`.
    Users of the `SharedTree` type should use `ISharedTree`.

-   tree: Minor API fixes for "@fluidframework/tree" package. ([#19057](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/issues/19057)) [3e0f218832](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/3e0f21883255317f8bb1f7c420543650502a5b66)

    Rename `IterableTreeListContent` to `IterableTreeArrayContent`, inline `TreeMapNodeBase` into `TreeMapNode`, rename `TreeArrayNode.spread` to `TreeArrayNode.spread` and remove `create` which was not supposed to be public (use `TreeArrayNode.spread` instead).

## 2.0.0-rc.1.0.0

### Major Changes

-   @fluid-experimental/tree2 package renamed ([#18851](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/issues/18851)) [6161193ffe](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/6161193ffe661c3835c4f1ba2da78078dca10b4b)

    The package is now `@fluidframework/tree`.

### Minor Changes

-   Updated server dependencies ([#19122](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/issues/19122)) [25366b4229](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/25366b422918cb43685c5f328b50450749592902)

    The following Fluid server dependencies have been updated to the latest version, 3.0.0. [See the full changelog.](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/releases/tag/server_v3.0.0)

    -   @fluidframework/server-services-telemetry
    -   @fluidframework/server-services-utils
    -   @fluidframework/server-test-utils
    -   tinylicious

-   Updated @fluidframework/protocol-definitions ([#19122](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/issues/19122)) [25366b4229](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/25366b422918cb43685c5f328b50450749592902)

    The @fluidframework/protocol-definitions dependency has been upgraded to v3.1.0. [See the full
    changelog.](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/blob/main/common/lib/protocol-definitions/CHANGELOG.md#310)

## 2.0.0-internal.8.0.0

### Major Changes

-   datastore-definitions: Jsonable and Serializable now require a generic parameter [9a451d4946](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/9a451d4946b5c51a52e4d1ab5bf51e7b285b0d74)

    The `Jsonable` and `Serializable` types from @fluidframework/datastore-definitions now require a generic parameter and
    if that type is `any` or `unknown`will return a new result `JsonableTypeWith<>` that more accurately represents the
    limitation of serialization.

    Additional modifications:

    -   `Jsonable`'s `TReplacement` parameter default has also been changed from `void` to `never`, which now disallows
        `void`.
    -   Unrecognized primitive types like `symbol` are now filtered to `never` instead of `{}`.
    -   Recursive types with arrays (`[]`) are now supported.

    `Serializable` is commonly used for DDS values and now requires more precision when using them. For example SharedMatrix
    (unqualified) has an `any` default that meant values were `Serializable<any>` (i.e. `any`), but now `Serializable<any>`
    is `JsonableTypeWith<IFluidHandle>` which may be problematic for reading or writing. Preferred correction is to specify
    the value type but casting through `any` may provide a quick fix.

## 2.0.0-internal.7.4.0

Dependency updates only.

## 2.0.0-internal.7.3.0

### Minor Changes

-   Rename SchemaCollection.treeSchema to nodeSchema ([#18067](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/issues/18067)) [be7ee4b383](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/be7ee4b383c86fbcb60e92b606bbd305d0157acb)

    This breaks all existing documents, as well as any users of SchemaCollection.treeSchema.

-   Remove editable-tree-1 ([#18169](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/issues/18169)) [f0100204bd](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/f0100204bd19f8be769a1163a655a185e7c1289e)

    Remove editable-tree-1 and APIs related to it. Users must migrate to editable-tree-2.

## 2.0.0-internal.7.2.0

### Minor Changes

-   tree2: Rename DocumentSchema and toDocumentSchema ([#17854](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/issues/17854)) [0b5944050d](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/0b5944050d3bc4470a87de4a4332235d37cb719c)

    The following APIs have been renamed:

    -   `DocumentSchema` is now `TreeSchema`
    -   `toDocumentSchema` is now `intoSchema`

-   tree2: Rename SchemaData, FieldSchema, and FieldStoredSchema ([#17888](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/issues/17888)) [27f5a5e24d](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/27f5a5e24dda81eafe5678742d68cd7d8afdc060)

    The following APIs have been renamed:

    -   `SchemaData` is now `TreeStoredSchema`
    -   `FieldSchema` is now `TreeFieldSchema`
    -   `FieldStoredSchema` is now `TreeFieldStoredSchema`

-   tree2: Add `null` to allowed leaf types ([#17781](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/issues/17781)) [040e28f3ab](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/040e28f3aba415e086fe2661e97d984c97b85045)

    Replaced the jsonNull schema with a new null leaf schema, and added support for leaf values which are null.

-   tree2: Rename TreeSchema ([#17845](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/issues/17845)) [908ee8921e](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/908ee8921eb8d7fc21f64eee88a12c678e9756dd)

    The following APIs have been renamed:

    -   `TreeSchema` is now `TreeNodeSchema`

-   tree2: Rename Struct ([#17899](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/issues/17899)) [d90af254fe](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/d90af254fe4224dd6391908e88055f3c98cc1d18)

    The following APIs have been renamed:

    -   `Struct` is now `ObjectNode`

## 2.0.0-internal.7.1.0

### Major Changes

-   tree2: Regressions and new node removal model ([#17304](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/issues/17304)) [935bae84a5](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/935bae84a513c7184025784e485ad64d23514f92)

    Regression 1: All changes are atomized by the `visitDelta` function. This means that, if you insert/remove/move 2 contiguous nodes, the `visitDelta` function will call the `DeltaVisitor` twice (once for each node) instead of once for both nodes. Anything that sits downstream from the `DeltaVisitor` will therefore also see those changes as atomized.

    Regression 2: The forest never forgets removed content so the memory will grow unbounded.

    Removed nodes are preserved as detached in the forest instead of deleted. Anchors to removed nodes remain valid.

    Change notification for node replacement in optional and required fields are now atomic.

    Updated `PathVisitor` API.

    Forest and AnchorSet are now updated in lockstep.

### Minor Changes

-   tree2: Allow ImplicitFieldSchema for non-recursive schema building ([#17683](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/issues/17683)) [c11e1ce593](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/c11e1ce59310c820117d06e4065bf42bed6b823d)

    SchemaBuilder now accepts `ImplicitFieldSchema` in many places which used to require `FieldSchema`.
    This allows `Required` fields to be implicitly specified from just their AllowedTypes.
    Additionally in these cases the AllowedTypes can be implicitly specified from a single `Any` or `TreeSchema`.

-   Remove SchemaBuilder.leaf ([#17773](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/issues/17773)) [674565130f](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/674565130ffdcf8d23dae858273b303d123587c4)

    Custom schema should use the predefined leaf domain, or wrap its leaf types instead of defining new leaf schema.

-   tree2: Forest summaries now include detached fields ([#17391](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/issues/17391)) [5b6bc74ca8](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/5b6bc74ca85470783c6f48c061385f128f4fc6f9)

    Forest summaries now include detached fields. This breaks existing documents.

-   tree2: Rename "Value" Multiplicity and FieldKind ([#17622](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/issues/17622)) [bb68aeb30c](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/bb68aeb30cfb3d4e0e82f04f1771ad4cb69e23af)

    `Multiplicity.Value` has been renamed to `Multiplicity.Single` and `FieldKinds.value` has been renamed to `FieldKinds.required`.

-   tree2: SharedTreeFactory type changed ([#17588](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/issues/17588)) [7ebe2b7a79](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/7ebe2b7a7962e4b9a87c305cc48ffc00b1e57583)

    The 'type' field for @fluid-experimental/tree2's exported `IChannelFactory`s has been changed to not overlap with @fluid-experimental/tree's channel type.
    This breaks existing tree2 documents: upon loading them, an error with message "Channel Factory SharedTree not registered" will be thrown.
    If using the typed-tree API, the message will instead be "Channel Factory SharedTree:<subtype> not registered" where <subtype> is the subtype used by
    the application when constructing their `TypedTreeFactory`.

    Applications which want to support such documents could add an explicit registry entry to their `ISharedObjectRegistry` which maps the type shown in the error message to a factory producing @fluid-experimental/tree2.

## 2.0.0-internal.7.0.0

### Major Changes

-   Dependencies on @fluidframework/protocol-definitions package updated to 3.0.0 [871b3493dd](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/871b3493dd0d7ea3a89be64998ceb6cb9021a04e)

    This included the following changes from the protocol-definitions release:

    -   Updating signal interfaces for some planned improvements. The intention is split the interface between signals
        submitted by clients to the server and the resulting signals sent from the server to clients.
        -   A new optional type member is available on the ISignalMessage interface and a new ISentSignalMessage interface has
            been added, which will be the typing for signals sent from the client to the server. Both extend a new
            ISignalMessageBase interface that contains common members.
    -   The @fluidframework/common-definitions package dependency has been updated to version 1.0.0.

-   Server upgrade: dependencies on Fluid server packages updated to 2.0.1 [871b3493dd](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/871b3493dd0d7ea3a89be64998ceb6cb9021a04e)

    -   @fluidframework/server-services-utils: 2.0.1
    -   @fluidframework/server-test-utils: 2.0.1
    -   tinylicious: 2.0.1

-   Minimum TypeScript version now 5.1.6 [871b3493dd](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/871b3493dd0d7ea3a89be64998ceb6cb9021a04e)

    The minimum supported TypeScript version for Fluid 2.0 clients is now 5.1.6.

## 2.0.0-internal.6.4.0

### Minor Changes

-   tree2: Replace ValueSchema.Serializable with FluidHandle ([#17306](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/issues/17306)) [99b1f7192e](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/99b1f7192ec9fed19e2a76d9251c3fd123ae90e0)

    Replace ValueSchema.Serializable with FluidHandle, removing support for arbitrary objects as tree values and preventing "any" type from Serializable from infecting TreeValue.

-   tree2: Restrict struct field names to avoid collisions with schema2 names ([#17089](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/issues/17089)) [8f8294188f](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/8f8294188f554e6cc708d6cbbde4ea1dd2e52728)

    Struct field names are now restricted to avoid collisions with schema2 names.

## 2.0.0-internal.6.3.0

### Minor Changes

-   Decouple Forest and Schema. ([#17139](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/issues/17139)) [c6b69f5c19](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/c6b69f5c1957ceda7bebe6a31a570b49505e298b)

    Forest no longer exports the schema, nor invalidates when schema changes.

## 2.0.0-internal.6.2.0

### Minor Changes

-   Remove use of @fluidframework/common-definitions ([#16638](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/issues/16638)) [a8c81509c9](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/a8c81509c9bf09cfb2092ebcf7265205f9eb6dbf)

    The **@fluidframework/common-definitions** package is being deprecated, so the following interfaces and types are now
    imported from the **@fluidframework/core-interfaces** package:

    -   interface IDisposable
    -   interface IErrorEvent
    -   interface IErrorEvent
    -   interface IEvent
    -   interface IEventProvider

## 2.0.0-internal.6.0.0

### Major Changes

-   Upgraded typescript transpilation target to ES2020 [8abce8cdb4](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/8abce8cdb4e2832fb6405fb44e393bef03d5648a)

    Upgraded typescript transpilation target to ES2020. This is done in order to decrease the bundle sizes of Fluid Framework packages. This has provided size improvements across the board for ex. Loader, Driver, Runtime etc. Reduced bundle sizes helps to load lesser code in apps and hence also helps to improve the perf.If any app wants to target any older versions of browsers with which this target version is not compatible, then they can use packages like babel to transpile to a older target.

## 2.0.0-internal.5.4.0

### Minor Changes

-   Remove support for Global Fields ([#16546](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/issues/16546)) [cade66e2fd](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/cade66e2fd55e92109e337ad1801e8751000c2bf)

    Support for Global fields has been removed.

-   Old SchemaBuilder APIs removed ([#16373](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/issues/16373)) [38bcf98635](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/38bcf98635f35c4e0994798e18ae62389da2a773)

    Remove old SchemaBuilder APIs in favor of Schema2 design.

## 2.0.0-internal.5.3.0

### Minor Changes

-   Move closeAndGetPendingLocalState to IContainerExperimental ([#16302](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/issues/16302)) [93151af787](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/93151af787b76e547cf3460df47f81832131db8c)

    This change deprecates the experimental method closeAndGetPendingLocalState on IContainer and moves it to IContainerExperimental.
    IContainerExperimental is an interface that is easily casted to, which enables partners to access experimental features for testing and evaluation.
    Moving the experimental method off IContainer will reduce exposure and churn on that production interface as we iterate on and finalize our experimental features.
    Experimental features should not be used in production environments.

### Major Changes

-   Renamed from `@fluid-internal/tree` to `@fluid-experimental/tree2` so that this package will be included in releases for experimental use.

### Minor Changes

-   Op compression is enabled by default ([#14856](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/pull-requests/14856)) [439c21f31f](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/439c21f31f4a3ea6515f01d2b2be7f35c04910ce)

    If the size of a batch is larger than 614kb, the ops will be compressed. After upgrading to this version, if batches exceed the size threshold, the runtime will produce a new type of op with the compression properties. To open a document which contains this type of op, the client's runtime version needs to be at least `client_v2.0.0-internal.2.3.0`. Older clients will close with assert `0x3ce` ("Runtime message of unknown type") and will not be able to open the documents until they upgrade. To minimize the risk, it is recommended to audit existing session and ensure that at least 99.9% of them are using a runtime version equal or greater than `client_v2.0.0-internal.2.3.0`, before upgrading to `2.0.0-internal.4.1.0`.

    More information about op compression can be found
    [here](./packages/runtime/container-runtime/src/opLifecycle/README.md).
