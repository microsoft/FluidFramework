# @fluidframework/shared-summary-block

SharedSummaryBlock is a DDS that does not generate ops but is part of the summary. The name block comes from the fact that the data in this object is shared across clients only via summary blocks.
The data on this object must only be set in response to a remote op. Basically, if we replay same ops, the set of calls on this object to set data should be the same. This is critical because it does not generate ops of its own, but relies on the above principle to maintain eventual consistency and to summarize.

## Using Fluid Framework libraries

When taking a dependency on a Fluid Framework library, we recommend using a `^` (caret) version range, such as `^1.3.4`.
While Fluid Framework libraries may use different ranges with interdependencies between other Fluid Framework libraries,
library consumers should always prefer `^`.

Note that when depending on a library version of the form `2.0.0-internal.x.y.z`, called the Fluid internal version scheme,
you must use a `>= <` dependency range (such as `>=2.0.0-internal.x.y.z <2.0.0-internal.w.0.0` where `w` is `x+1`).
Standard `^` and `~` ranges will not work as expected.
See the [@fluid-tools/version-tools](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/blob/main/build-tools/packages/version-tools/README.md)
package for more information including tools to convert between version schemes.
