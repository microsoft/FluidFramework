## 2.0.0-internal.4.1.0

### Minor Changes

-   IntervalConflictResolver deprecation ([#15089](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/pull-requests/15089)) [38345841a7](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/38345841a75d68e94748823c3da5078a2fc57449)

    In `SharedString`, interval conflict resolvers have been unused since [this
    change](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/pull/6407), which added support for multiple intervals at the same
    position. As such, any existing usages can be removed. Related APIs have been deprecated and will be removed in an
    upcoming release.
