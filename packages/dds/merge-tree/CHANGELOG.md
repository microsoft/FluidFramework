### Minor Changes

-   Deprecate unnecessary exports ([#16097](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/issues/16097)) [9486bec0ea](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/9486bec0ea2f9f1dd3e40fc3b4c42af6b6a44697)

    This change deprecates a number of interfaces in the merge tree package that are not used in the exported apis surface and therefore should not be used.

-   Deprecate ISegment.parent ([#16097](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/issues/16097)) [9486bec0ea](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/9486bec0ea2f9f1dd3e40fc3b4c42af6b6a44697)

    This change deprecates the parent property on the ISegment interface. The property will still exist, but should not generally be used by outside consumers.

    There are some circumstances where a consumer may wish to know if a segment is still in the underlying tree and were using the parent property to determine that.

    Please change those checks to use the following `"parent" in segment && segment.parent !== undefined`

### Minor Changes

-   New APIs for interval querying by range ([#15837](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/issues/15837)) [2a4242e1b5](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/2a4242e1b5f15442b13ae413124ec76315a4cc52)

    SharedString now supports querying intervals whose start/end-points fall in a specified range.

## 2.0.0-internal.4.4.0

### Minor Changes

-   New feature: Revertibles for SharedString and Interval provide undo-redo functionality. This includes all direct interval edits as well as string edits that indirectly affect intervals, wrapping merge-tree revertibles.
