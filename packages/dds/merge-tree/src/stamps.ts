 * A stamp that identifies provenance of an operation performed on the MergeTree.
 *
 * Stamps identify a point in time (`seq`/`localSeq`) as well as the source (`clientId`) for the operation.
 * This provides enough information to linearize all known applied operations: acked operations happen before
 * local+unacked ones, with acked operations ordered by their sequence numbers and local+unacked operations
 * ordered by their localSeq.
 *
 * By including `clientId`, it also provides enough information to resolve whether segments are visible
 * from alternative perspectives: a remote client will have seen all of its own previous operations as well as
 * those at or below the op's reference sequence number.
 *
 * @remarks - As the `readonly` identifies suggest, these stamps should be treated as immutable.
 * New operations applied to a merge-tree should create new stamps rather than modify existing ones (e.g. when
 * a change's ack happens).
