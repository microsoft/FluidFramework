/**
 * This is a special segment that is not bound or known by the merge tree itself,
 * but the segment itself pretends to be a removed segment at an endpoint of the
 * tree. It is removed so it appears as a undefined/0 length segment. This segment
 * adds the capability to hold local references that have been detached from the
 * real merge tree, and give the appearance that they exist at an endpoint of the
 * tree.
 *
 * This is useful today in 2 cases: detached references and interval stickiness.
 *
 * In general, local references only become detached when the tree becomes empty
 * and the EndOfTreeSegment allows us to gracefully handle that case by giving
 * those references a place to live.
 *
 * In the case of interval stickiness, it is desirable to be able to refer to
 * the position immediately after or before a segment, in order for the endpoint
 * of an interval to be exclusive. This means that in order to support intervals
 * that are exclusive and also include the first or last segment of the tree, it
 * must be possible in some way to refer to a position before or after the tree
 * respectively. The endpoint segments allow us to support such behavior.
