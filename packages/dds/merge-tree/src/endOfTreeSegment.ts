/**
 * This is a special segment that is not bound or known by the merge tree itself, but the segment itself pretends
 * to be a removed segment at the end of the tree. It is removed so it appears as a undefined/0 length segment.
 * This segment adds the capability to hold local references that have been detached from the real merge tree,
 * and give the appearance that they exist at the end of the tree. In general, local references only become detached
 * when the tree becomes empty and the EndOfTreeSegment allows us to gracefully handle that case by giving those
 * references a place to live. The EndOfTreeSegment is not in itself a generalized solution to the problem of
 * detached references, as it requires special and careful understanding of its usage. Specifically, it is local only
 * and would not lead to eventually consistent results if serialization of its contained references was attempted,
 * as on deserialization a naive re-insertion would not put the back into the EndOfTreeSegment
 * leading to inconsistent results with existing clients.
