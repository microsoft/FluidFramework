/**
 * Keeps track of partial sums of segment lengths for all sequence numbers in the current collaboration window.
 * Only used during active collaboration.
 *
 * This class is associated with an internal node (block) of a MergeTree. It efficiently answers queries of the form
 * "What is the length of `block` from the perspective of some particular seq and clientId?".
 *
 * It also supports incremental updating of state for newly-sequenced ops that don't affect the structure of the
 * MergeTree (in most cases--see AB#31003 or comments on {@link PartialSequenceLengths.update}).
 *
 * To answer these queries, it pre-builds several lists which track the length of the block at a per-sequence-number
 * level. These lists are:
 *
 * 1. (`partialLengths`): Stores the total length of the block.
 * 2. (`perClientAdjustments[clientId]`): Stores adjustments to the base length which account for all changes submitted by `clientId`. [see footnote]
 *
 * The reason both lists are necessary is that resolving the length of the block from the perspective of
 * (clientId, refSeq) requires including both of the following types of segments:
 * 1. Segments sequenced before `refSeq`
 * 2. Segments submitted by `clientId`
 *
 * This is possible with the above bookkeeping, using:
 *
 * (length of the block at the minimum sequence number)
 * + (partialLengths total length at refSeq)
 * + (clientSeqNumbers total length at most recent op)
 * - (clientSeqNumbers total length at refSeq)
 *
 * where the subtraction avoids double-counting segments submitted by clientId sequenced within the collab window.
 *
 * To enable reconnect, if constructed with `computeLocalPartials === true` it also supports querying for the length of
 * the block from the perspective of the local client at a particular `refSeq` and `localSeq`. This computation is
 * similar to the above:
 *
 * (length of the block at the minimum sequence number)
 * + (partialLengths total length at refSeq)
 * + (unsequenced edits' total length submitted before localSeq)
 * + (adjustments for changes double-counted by happening at or before both localSeq and refSeq)
 *
 * This algorithm scales roughly linearly with number of editing clients and the size of the collab window.
 * (certain unlikely sequences of operations may introduce log factors on those variables)
 *
 * @privateRemarks
 * If you are looking to understand this class in more detail, a suggested order of internalization is:
 *
 * 1. The above description and how it relates to the implementation of `getPartialLength` (which implements the above high-level description
 * 2. `PartialSequenceLengthsSet`, which allows binary searching for overall length deltas at a given sequence number and handles updates.
 * 3. The `fromLeaves` method, which is the base case for the [potential] recursion in `combine`
 * 4. The logic in `combine` to aggregate smaller block entries into larger ones
 * 5. The incremental code path of `update`

	 * perClientAdjustments[clientId] contains a PartialSequenceLengthsSet of adjustments to the observer client's
	 * perspective (see {@link PartialSequenceLengths.partialLengths}) necessary to account for changes made by
	 * that client.
	 *
	 * As per doc comment on {@link PartialSequenceLengths}, the overall adjustment performed for the perspective of
	 * (clientId, refSeq) is given by the sum of length deltas in `perClientAdjustments[clientId]`
	 * for all sequence numbers S such that S \>= refSeq.
	 *
	 * (since these are ordered by sequence number and we cache cumulative sums, this is implemented using two lookups and a subtraction).
	 *
	 * The specific adjustments are roughly categorized as follows:
	 *
	 * - Ops submitted by a given client generally receive a partial lengths entry corresponding to their sequence number.
	 * e.g. insert of "ABC" at seq 5 will have a per-client adjustment entry of \{ seq: 5, seglen: 3 \}.
	 *
	 * - When client A deletes a segment concurrently with client B and loses the race (B's delete is sequenced first),
	 * A's per-client adjustments will contain an entry with a negative `seglen` corresponding to the length of the segment
	 * and a sequence number corresponding to that of B's delete. It will *not* receive a per-client adjustment for its own delete.
	 * This ensures that for perspectives (A, refSeq), the deleted segment will show up as a negative delta for all values of refSeq, since:
	 * 1. For refSeq \< B's delete, the per-client adjustment will apply and be added to the total length
	 * 2. For refSeq \>= B's delete, B's partial length entry in the overall set will apply, and the per-client adjustment will not apply
	 *
	 * - When client A attempts to insert a segment into a location that is concurrently obliterated by client B immediately upon insertion,
	 * A's per-client adjustments will again not include an entry for its own insert.
	 * Instead, the entry which would normally contain `seq` equal to that of A's insert would instead have `seq` equal to that of B's obliterate.
	 * This gives the overall correct behavior: for any perspective which isn't client A, there is no adjustment necessary anywhere (it's as if
	 * the segment never existed). For client A's perspective, the segment should be considered visible until A has acked B's obliterate.
	 * This is accomplished as for the perspective (A, refSeq):
	 * 1. For refSeq \< B's obliterate, the segment length will be included as part of the per-client adjustment for A
	 * 2. For refSeq \>= B's obliterate, the segment will be omitted from the per-client adjustment for A
	 *
	 * Note that the special-casing for inserting segments that are immediately obliterated is only necessary for segments that never were visible
	 * in the tree. If an insert and obliterate are concurrent but the insert is sequenced first, the normal per-client adjustment is fine.
	 *
	 * The second case (overlapping removal) applies to any combination of remove / obliterate operations.
