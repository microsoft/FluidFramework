	 * Semantically, `localSeq`s provide an ordering on in-flight merge-tree operations:
	 * for operations stamped with localSeqs `a` and `b`, `a < b` if and only if `a` was submitted before `b`.
	 *
	 * @remarks - This field is analogous to the `clientSequenceNumber` field on ops, but it's accessible to merge-tree
	 * at op submission time rather than only at ack time. This enables more natural state tracking for in-flight ops.
	 *
	 * It's useful to stamp ops with such an incrementing counter because it enables reasoning about which segments existed from
	 * the perspective of the local client at a given point in 'un-acked' time, which is necessary to support the reconnect flow.
	 *
	 * For example, imagine a client with initial state "123456" submits some ops to create the text "123456ABC".
	 * If they insert the "C" first, then "B", then "A", their local segment state might look like this:
	 * ```js
	 * [
	 *     { seq: 0, text: "1234" },
	 *     { seq: 5, text: "56" },
	 *     { localSeq: 3, seq: UnassignedSequenceNumber, text: "A" },
	 *     { localSeq: 2, seq: UnassignedSequenceNumber, text: "B" },
	 *     { localSeq: 1, seq: UnassignedSequenceNumber, text: "C" },
	 * ]
	 * ```
	 * (note that localSeq tracks the localSeq at which a segment was inserted)
	 *
	 * Suppose the client then disconnects and reconnects before any of its insertions are acked. The reconnect flow will necessitate
	 * that the client regenerates and resubmits ops based on its current segment state as well as the original op that was sent.
	 *
	 * It will generate the ops
	 * 1. \{ pos: 6, text: "C" \}
	 * 2. \{ pos: 6, text: "B" \}
	 * 3. \{ pos: 6, text: "A" \}
	 *
	 * since when submitting the first op, remote clients don't know that this client is about to submit the "A" and "B".
	 *
	 * On the other hand, imagine if the client had originally submitted the ops in the order "A", "B", "C"
	 * such that the segments' local state was instead:
	 *
	 * ```js
	 * [
	 *     { seq: 0, text: "1234" },
	 *     { seq: 5, text: "56" },
	 *     { localSeq: 1, seq: UnassignedSequenceNumber, text: "A" },
	 *     { localSeq: 2, seq: UnassignedSequenceNumber, text: "B" },
	 *     { localSeq: 3, seq: UnassignedSequenceNumber, text: "C" },
	 * ]
	 * ```
	 *
	 * The resubmitted ops should instead be:
	 * 1. \{ pos: 6, text: "A" \}
	 * 2. \{ pos: 7, text: "B" \}
	 * 3. \{ pos: 8, text: "C" \}
	 *
	 * since remote clients will have seen the "A" when processing the "B" as well as both the "A" and "B" when processing the "C".
	 * As can be seen, the list of resubmitted ops is different in the two cases despite the merge-tree's segment state only differing
	 * in `localSeq`.
	 *
	 * This example is a bit simplified from the general scenario: since no remote clients modified the merge-tree while the client
	 * was disconnected, the resubmitted ops end up matching the original ops exactly.
	 * However, this is not generally true: the production reconnect code takes into account visibility of segments based on both acked
	 * and local information as appropriate.
	 * Nonetheless, this simple scenario is enough to understand why it's useful to be able to determine if a segment should be visible
	 * from a given (seq, localSeq) perspective.
