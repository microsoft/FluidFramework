/**
 * Helper for authoring tests which perform operations on a number of clients.
 * This class essentially serves the role of the server in that it maintains a sequencing order of ops as well as information
 * about the latest op that each client has applied.
 *
 * When using this class, *do not* perform operations which may submit ops on clients directly: it does not currently wire up client events
 * to the server. Instead, use methods on the helper and pass the client name they should apply to as the first argument.
 *
 * It is analogous to MockContainerRuntimeFactory in the test-runtime-utils package, though the APIs are not completely equivalent
 * (see for example differences noted on disconnect and reconnect).
 *
 * This helper is also designed to support advancing only some clients to a given sequence number
 * (not all clients must be synchronized at the same time).
 *
 * This allows testing sequences of operations where clients have varying refSeqs, rather than having all clients advance refSeq
 * in lockstep.
 *
 * @remarks
 * If we wired the server up to "delta" events on the client, it would be reasonable to rename this to `MockServer` and the API for tests
 * would be a bit cleaner.

	 * Causes the provided clients to "disconnect" by isolating their outbound queue from the op stream.
	 * These clients will still receive ops from this helper just like all other clients.
	 * When a client reconnects (see {@link reconnect}), the helper will rebase all of the client's pending ops (that they submitted since
	 * `disconnect` was called) and re-add them to the op stream.
	 *
	 * BEWARE: This is slightly different from what the mocks in test-runtime-utils do in two ways:
	 *
	 * 1. Those mocks actually wipe outstanding ops submitted by the disconnected clients from the op stream and rebases those as well.
	 * 2. Those mocks freeze the inbound queue of the disconnected clients as well as the outbound queue.
	 *
	 * E.g. (pseudocode; syntax is different for those mocks and these):
	 *
	 * ```typescript
	 * B.submitLocalOp1()
	 * B.submitLocalOp2()
	 * disconnect(B)
	 * A.submitLocalOp1()
	 * B.submitLocalOp3()
	 * processAllOps()
	 * ```
	 *
	 * the test-runtime-mocks will...
	 *
	 * - have none of B's local ops be receieved by A in the processAllOps() line
	 * - have B not receive A's local op 1
	 *
	 * whereas this helper will...
	 *
	 * - have B's local ops 1 and 2 be received by A, but not its third local op
	 * - have B receive acks for its first two local ops as well as A's op in the processAllOps() line
	 *
	 * This operation is a no-op if called multiple times on the same client with no intervening reconnects.
