# We technically don't need to distribute the compiled test code, but because it's imported in the sequence package,
# including it in the package makes it a lot easier to test using standardized tools. If we don't include the test code,
# then the ./test export is invalid, so it will fail to import anywhere outside the repo. However, some of the contents
# of the test folder is not needed for testing, so we exclude additional paths.
