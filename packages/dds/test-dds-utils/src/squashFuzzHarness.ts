/**
 * Creates a fuzz test targetting correctness of a DDS's "squash" functionality while resubmitting ops.
 *
 * This model is an extension of `createDDSFuzzSuite`. In addition to whatever set of operations are defined in the DDS's
 * eventual consistency model, this harness also injects the notion of each client entering/exiting a "staging mode".
 *
 * While in staging mode, DDS models should sometimes opt to add "poisoned content" to the document. They do so by generating a
 * 'poisoned handle' using {@link SquashRandom.poisonedHandle}. If this handle is ever sent to another client, the harness will
 * detect this and fail the test.
 *
 * This model helps fuzz test correctness of squash functionality, as before a client exits staging mode, the harness will place it
 * in an "exiting" state and invoke {@link SquashFuzzModel.exitingStagingModeGeneratorFactory} to allow the model to remove any poisoned content from the document.
 * If the DDS's resubmit implementation correctly squashes this insertion+removal of content, this means that other clients should never see it.
 *
 * To do this incrementally, typically a model would want to augment its per-client state with information about where the poisoned content lives in a way that is
 * stable across edits. The {@link DDSFuzzHarnessEvents} event "clientCreate" is a good place to set up any initial state, and specific operations which add poisoned content
 * can augment this state. Other implementations (such as exhaustively walking the DDS contents to look for poisoned content) are also possible, but less efficient.
 *
 * Models should not generate poisoned handles while staging mode is off. This harness will also detect this and report an error indicating
 * the model author has a bug.
 *
 * Model authors should attempt to cover all possible notions by which content may be "added then removed" from their DDS.
