/**
 * Represents a generic fuzz model for testing eventual consistency of a DDS.
 *
 * @remarks
 *
 * Typical DDSes will parameterize this with their SharedObject factory and a serializable set
 * of operations corresponding to valid edits in the DDS's public API.
 *
 * @example
 * A simplified SharedString data structure exposing the APIs `insertAt(index, contentString)` and `removeRange(start, end)`
 * might represent their API with the following operations:
 * ```typescript
 * type InsertOperation = { type: "insert"; index: number; content: string }
 * type RemoveOperation = { type: "remove"; start: number; end: number }
 * type Operation = InsertOperation | RemoveOperation;
 * ```
 *
 * It would then typically use utilities from \@fluid-internal/stochastic-test-utils to write a generator
 * for inserting/removing content, and a reducer for interpreting the serializable operations in terms of
 * SimpleSharedString's public API.
 *
 * See \@fluid-internal/stochastic-test-utils's README for more details on this step.
 *
 * Then, it could define a model like so:
 * ```typescript
 * const model: DDSFuzzModel<SimpleSharedStringFactory, Operation> = {
 *     workloadName: "insert and delete",
 *     factory: SimpleSharedStringFactory,
 *     generatorFactory: myGeneratorFactory,
 *     reducer: myReducer,
 *     // A non-toy implementation would typically give a more informative assertion error (e.g. including
 *     // the IDs for `a` and `b`).
 *     validateConsistency: (a, b) => { assert.equal(a.getText(), b.getText()); }
 * }
 * ```
 * This model can be used directly to create a suite of fuzz tests with {@link createDDSFuzzSuite}
