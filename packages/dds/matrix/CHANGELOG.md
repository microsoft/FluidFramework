### Minor Changes

-   Update to TypeScript 5.4 ([#21214](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/pull/21214)) [0e6256c722](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/0e6256c722d8bf024f4325bf02547daeeb18bfa6)

    Update package implementations to use TypeScript 5.4.5.

## 2.0.0-rc.4.0.0

### Minor Changes

-   Deprecated members of IFluidHandle are split off into new IFluidHandleInternal interface [96872186d0](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/96872186d0d0f245c1fece7d19b3743e501679b6)

    Split IFluidHandle into two interfaces, `IFluidHandle` and `IFluidHandleInternal`.
    Code depending on the previously deprecated members of IFluidHandle can access them by using `toFluidHandleInternal` from `@fluidframework/runtime-utils/legacy`.

    External implementation of the `IFluidHandle` interface are not supported: this change makes the typing better convey this using the `ErasedType` pattern.
    Any existing and previously working, and now broken, external implementations of `IFluidHandle` should still work at runtime, but will need some unsafe type casts to compile.
    Such handle implementation may break in the future and thus should be replaced with use of handles produced by the Fluid Framework client packages.

-   matrix: SharedMatrix class hidden [96872186d0](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/96872186d0d0f245c1fece7d19b3743e501679b6)

    The `SharedMatrix` class has been hidden from the alpha API.
    In its place:

    -   The constant `SharedMatrix` is exposed as the entrypoint for `SharedMatrix` creation. See documentation on `ISharedObjectKind`.
    -   The type `SharedMatrix` is aliased to `ISharedMatrix`, which contains matrix's public API. This API has no semantic changes from previous versions.

    Additionally, `SharedMatrixFactory` has been deprecated. Rather than construct the factory directly, use `SharedMatrix.getFactory()` (e.g. for usage in `DataObject` registries).

    This change is part of a larger effort to clean up the API surface of various DDSes we have to leak less implementation details. See e.g. #20030.
    Most code which uses `SharedMatrix` should continue to function without changes.

## 2.0.0-rc.3.0.0

### Major Changes

-   Packages now use package.json "exports" and require modern module resolution [97d68aa06b](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/97d68aa06bd5c022ecb026655814aea222a062ae)

    Fluid Framework packages have been updated to use the [package.json "exports"
    field](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v18.x/api/packages.html#exports) to define explicit entry points for both
    TypeScript types and implementation code.

    This means that using Fluid Framework packages require the following TypeScript settings in tsconfig.json:

    -   `"moduleResolution": "Node16"` with `"module": "Node16"`
    -   `"moduleResolution": "Bundler"` with `"module": "ESNext"`

    We recommend using Node16/Node16 unless absolutely necessary. That will produce transpiled JavaScript that is suitable
    for use with modern versions of Node.js _and_ Bundlers.
    [See the TypeScript documentation](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#moduleResolution) for more information
    regarding the module and moduleResolution options.

    **Node10 moduleResolution is not supported; it does not support Fluid Framework's API structuring pattern that is used
    to distinguish stable APIs from those that are in development.**

    The following Fluid server dependencies have been updated to the latest version, 3.0.0. [See the full changelog.](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/releases/tag/server_v3.0.0)

    -   @fluidframework/gitresources
    -   @fluidframework/server-kafka-orderer
    -   @fluidframework/server-lambdas
    -   @fluidframework/server-lambdas-driver

    -   @fluidframework/server-services-telemetry
    -   @fluidframework/server-services-utils
    -   @fluidframework/server-test-utils
    -   tinylicious

-   Updated @fluidframework/protocol-definitions ([#19122](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/issues/19122)) [25366b4229](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/25366b422918cb43685c5f328b50450749592902)

    The @fluidframework/protocol-definitions dependency has been upgraded to v3.1.0. [See the full
    changelog.](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/blob/main/common/lib/protocol-definitions/CHANGELOG.md#310)

-   shared-object-base: SharedObject processGCDataCore now takes IFluidSerializer rather than SummarySerializer ([#18803](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/issues/18803)) [396b8e9738](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/396b8e9738156ff88b62424a0076f09fb5028a32)

    This change should be a no-op for consumers, and `SummarySerializer` and `IFluidSerializer` expose the same consumer facing APIs. This change just makes our APIs more consistent by only using interfaces, rather than a mix of interfaces and concrete implementations.

## 2.0.0-internal.8.0.0

### Major Changes

-   sequence: Some function return types are now void instead of any [9a451d4946](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/9a451d4946b5c51a52e4d1ab5bf51e7b285b0d74)

    The return types of some functions have changed from `any` to `void` because the projects are now being compiled with
    the `noImplicitAny` TypeScript compilation option. This does not represent a logic change and only serves to make the
    typing of these functions more accurate.

-   datastore-definitions: Jsonable and Serializable now require a generic parameter [9a451d4946](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/9a451d4946b5c51a52e4d1ab5bf51e7b285b0d74)

    The `Jsonable` and `Serializable` types from @fluidframework/datastore-definitions now require a generic parameter and
    if that type is `any` or `unknown`will return a new result `JsonableTypeWith<>` that more accurately represents the
    limitation of serialization.

    Additional modifications:

    -   `Jsonable`'s `TReplacement` parameter default has also been changed from `void` to `never`, which now disallows
        `void`.
    -   Unrecognized primitive types like `symbol` are now filtered to `never` instead of `{}`.
    -   Recursive types with arrays (`[]`) are now supported.

    `Serializable` is commonly used for DDS values and now requires more precision when using them. For example SharedMatrix
    (unqualified) has an `any` default that meant values were `Serializable<any>` (i.e. `any`), but now `Serializable<any>`
    is `JsonableTypeWith<IFluidHandle>` which may be problematic for reading or writing. Preferred correction is to specify
    the value type but casting through `any` may provide a quick fix.

### Major Changes

-   Dependencies on @fluidframework/protocol-definitions package updated to 3.0.0 [871b3493dd](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/871b3493dd0d7ea3a89be64998ceb6cb9021a04e)

    This included the following changes from the protocol-definitions release:

    -   Updating signal interfaces for some planned improvements. The intention is split the interface between signals
        submitted by clients to the server and the resulting signals sent from the server to clients.
        -   A new optional type member is available on the ISignalMessage interface and a new ISentSignalMessage interface has
            been added, which will be the typing for signals sent from the client to the server. Both extend a new
            ISignalMessageBase interface that contains common members.
    -   The @fluidframework/common-definitions package dependency has been updated to version 1.0.0.

-   Server upgrade: dependencies on Fluid server packages updated to 2.0.1 [871b3493dd](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/871b3493dd0d7ea3a89be64998ceb6cb9021a04e)

### Minor Changes

-   Remove use of @fluidframework/common-definitions ([#16638](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/issues/16638)) [a8c81509c9](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/a8c81509c9bf09cfb2092ebcf7265205f9eb6dbf)

    The **@fluidframework/common-definitions** package is being deprecated, so the following interfaces and types are now

### Major Changes

-   Upgraded typescript transpilation target to ES2020 [8abce8cdb4](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/8abce8cdb4e2832fb6405fb44e393bef03d5648a)

    Upgraded typescript transpilation target to ES2020. This is done in order to decrease the bundle sizes of Fluid Framework packages. This has provided size improvements across the board for ex. Loader, Driver, Runtime etc. Reduced bundle sizes helps to load lesser code in apps and hence also helps to improve the perf.If any app wants to target any older versions of browsers with which this target version is not compatible, then they can use packages like babel to transpile to a older target.
