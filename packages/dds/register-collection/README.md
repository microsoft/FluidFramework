# @fluidframework/register-collection

A consensus register collection is a distributed data structure (DDS), which holds a set of registers and their versions generated during concurrent updates. In the simplest definition, two updates on a single register are concurrent if there is no causal relationship between them (i.e., neither knows about the other). On such cases of concurrent updates, a register internally stores all possible versions of a value.

## Using Fluid Framework libraries

When taking a dependency on a Fluid Framework library's public APIs, we recommend using a `^` (caret) version range, such as `^1.3.4`.
While Fluid Framework libraries may use different ranges with interdependencies between other Fluid Framework libraries,
library consumers should always prefer `^`.

If using any of Fluid Framework's unstable APIs (for example, its `beta` APIs), we recommend using a more constrained version range, such as `~`.

## Installation

To get started, install the package by running the following command:

```bash
npm i @fluidframework/register-collection
```

## Importing from this package

This package leverages [package.json exports](https://nodejs.org/api/packages.html#exports) to separate its APIs by support level.
For more information on the related support guarantees, see [API Support Levels](https://fluidframework.com/docs/build/releases-and-apitags/#api-support-levels).

To access the `public` ([SemVer](https://semver.org/)) APIs, import via `@fluidframework/register-collection` like normal.

To access the `legacy` APIs, import via `@fluidframework/register-collection/legacy`.

## API Documentation

API documentation for **@fluidframework/register-collection** is available at <https://fluidframework.com/docs/apis/register-collection>.

### Detecting concurrency in Fluid

In distributed systems literature, detecting concurrency requires some form of logical/physical clock. A popular technique used in replicated databases such as dynamodb is called version vectors where each key stores a collection of `[time, value]` tuples. `time` is essentially a reference clock used to decide concurrency amongst updates. Each update to a key includes the `time`, essentially to indicate how `caught up` the replica was during that update.

In Fluid, each operation contains a referenceSequenceNumber (`refSeq`), which essentially refers to how caught up the client was (in terms of sequence number) during that update. We can use this property to implement a similar concurrency model. Mathematically, if an update has a `refSeq N`, it can overwrite/discard any other prior values with `sequenceNumber (seq) <= N`. It is safe to do so because the client must have seen all those updates before posting its own update. Hence this update is not concurrent with those overwritten updates. However, the update is still concurrent with any other update with `seq > N`. Therefore those versions are still kept.

### Conflict resolution policies

Below are the policies that the DDS implements:

-   Versions: Returns all stored concurrent versions. App is responsible for conflict resolution. Amazon's shopping cart policy based on dynamodb is a popular example of this policy.

-   LWW: The last write to a key always overwrites any prior writes (aka last write win policy). This is exactly same as Fluid's Shared Map policy.

-   Atomic: The policy follows the same semantics of a shared distributed lock. Amongst all concurrent updates, only the first writer wins. In distributed systems literature, the register update policy is called `Atomic`. This behavior requires a linearizable register. A linearizable register behaves as if there is only a single copy of the data, and that every operation appears to take effect atomically at one point in time. This definition implies that operations are executed in an well-defined order. On a concurrent update, we perform a `compare-and-set` operation, where we compare a register's stored `seq` with the incoming `refSeq`. The earliest operation overwriting the stored `seq` wins since every client reaches to an agreement on the value. Hence we can safely return the first value.

## Minimum Client Requirements

Fluid Framework client libraries support the platforms in this document.
These requirements are intentionally restrictive.
Within a major version series, we can relax these requirements, but we cannot make them stricter.
For a Long Term Support (LTS) version, we might need to support these platforms for several years.

Other configurations can work, but Fluid Framework does not support them.
If an unsupported configuration stops working, we do not classify this as a bug.
To request support for a configuration that is not listed, file an issue.
The product team will evaluate your request.
In the issue, specify the current status of the configuration:

-   The configuration works but needs official support.
-   The configuration does not work and requires changes.

### Supported Runtimes

-   Fluid Framework supports Node.js versions 22 and 24 while they receive [upstream support](https://nodejs.org/en/about/previous-releases).
    -   Fluid Framework will stop support for version 22 [when upstream support ends on 2027-04-30](https://github.com/nodejs/release#release-schedule).
    -   Fluid Framework does not support Node.js with the `--no-experimental-fetch` flag.
-   Fluid Framework supports modern browsers that support the ES2022 standard library.

### Supported Tools

-   [TypeScript 6.0](https://typescriptdocs.com/release-notes/TypeScript%206.0):
    -   Fluid Framework supports all [`strict`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig) options.
    -   Set the build targets (`lib`, `target`) to `ES2022` or later.
    -   Enable [`strictNullChecks`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig).
    -   Fluid Framework does not support [configuration options deprecated in TypeScript 6.0](https://typescriptdocs.com/release-notes/TypeScript%206.0#breaking-changes-and-deprecations-in-typescript-6-0).
    -   Fluid Framework does not fully support `exactOptionalPropertyTypes`.
        If you enable this option, do not use `in`, `Reflect.has`, `Object.hasOwn`, or `Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty` to narrow members of Fluid Framework types.
        These methods can incorrectly exclude `undefined` from the possible values.
-   [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) 5
    -   We do not require a specific bundler.
        Other bundlers that handle ES Modules can work, but we actively test only webpack.

### Module Resolution

In TypeScript `compilerOptions`, use [`Node16`, `Node20`, `NodeNext`, or `Bundler`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#moduleResolution) module resolution.
These settings follow the [Node.js v12+ ESM Resolution and Loading algorithm](https://nodejs.github.io/nodejs.dev/en/api/v20/esm/#resolution-and-loading-algorithm).

Do not use `Node10` module resolution.

### Module Formats

-   ES Modules:
    Use ES Modules to consume Fluid Framework client packages, including in Node.js.
-   CommonJS:
    Fluid Framework does not officially support CommonJS in version 3.0 or later.
