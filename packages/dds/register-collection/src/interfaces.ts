 * Consensus Register Collection.
 *
 * A consensus register collection is a distributed data structure, which holds a set of registers with update
 * versions. On concurrent updates, a register internally stores all possible versions of a value by using reference
 * sequence number of the incoming update.
 *
 * Using all the stored versions, we can then distinguish amongst different read policies. Below are the policies
 * we support:
 *
 * Atomic: Atomicity requires a linearizable register. A linearizable register behaves as if there is only a single
 * copy of the data, and that every operation appears to take effect atomically at one point in time. This definition
 * implies that operations are executed in an well-defined order. On a concurrent update, we perform a compare-and-set
 * operation, where we compare a register sequence number with the incoming reference sequence number.
 * The earliest operation overwriting prior sequence numbers wins since every client reaches to an agreement on
 * the value. So we can safely return the first value.
 *
 * LWW: The last write to a key always wins.
 *
