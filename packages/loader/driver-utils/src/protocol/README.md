These files should not be changed unless the Fluid service itself is changed, and
should be aligned with the service side definitions contained here:

server/routerlicious/packages/protocol-base

## Notes

The file names in this directory align with those in server/protocol-base to facilitate
copying/synchronization in the future, if desireable.
