# @fluidframework/driver-utils

## 2.0.0-rc.5.0.0

### Minor Changes

-   Update to TypeScript 5.4 ([#21214](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/pull/21214)) [0e6256c722](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/0e6256c722d8bf024f4325bf02547daeeb18bfa6)

    Update package implementations to use TypeScript 5.4.5.

## 2.0.0-rc.4.0.0

Dependency updates only.

## 2.0.0-rc.3.0.0

### Major Changes

-   Packages now use package.json "exports" and require modern module resolution [97d68aa06b](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/97d68aa06bd5c022ecb026655814aea222a062ae)

    Fluid Framework packages have been updated to use the [package.json "exports"
    field](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v18.x/api/packages.html#exports) to define explicit entry points for both
    TypeScript types and implementation code.

    This means that using Fluid Framework packages require the following TypeScript settings in tsconfig.json:

    -   `"moduleResolution": "Node16"` with `"module": "Node16"`
    -   `"moduleResolution": "Bundler"` with `"module": "ESNext"`

    We recommend using Node16/Node16 unless absolutely necessary. That will produce transpiled JavaScript that is suitable
    for use with modern versions of Node.js _and_ Bundlers.
    [See the TypeScript documentation](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#moduleResolution) for more information
    regarding the module and moduleResolution options.

    **Node10 moduleResolution is not supported; it does not support Fluid Framework's API structuring pattern that is used
    to distinguish stable APIs from those that are in development.**

## 2.0.0-rc.2.0.0

### Minor Changes

-   Resolved URLs no longer use non-standard protocols ([#19840](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/issues/19840)) [9d3d185183](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/9d3d1851830d953792a6dfad60dde6f1c59480de)

    Previously, `IResolvedUrl.url` could use a non-standard protocol like `fluid://`, `fluid-odsp://`, or `fluid-test://`. These have been replaced with `https://` to permit standards-compliant URL parsing.

-   driver-definitions: Deprecate `ISnapshotContents` ([#19314](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/issues/19314)) [fc731b69de](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/fc731b69deed4a2987e9b97d8918492d689bafbc)

    `ISnapshotContents` is deprecated. It has been replaced with `ISnapshot`.

-   driver-definitions: repositoryUrl removed from IDocumentStorageService ([#19522](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/issues/19522)) [90eb3c9d33](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/90eb3c9d33d80e24caa1393a50f414c5602f6aa3)

    The `repositoryUrl` member of `IDocumentStorageService` was unused and always equal to the empty string. It has been removed.

-   Deprecated error-related enums have been removed ([#19067](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/issues/19067)) [59793302e5](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/59793302e56784cfb6ace0e6469345f3565b3312)

    Error-related enums `ContainerErrorType`, `DriverErrorType`, `OdspErrorType` and `RouterliciousErrorType` were previously
    deprecated and are now removed. There are replacement object-based enumerations of `ContainerErrorTypes`,
    `DriverErrorTypes`, `OdspErrorTypes` and `RouterliciousErrorTypes`. Refer to the release notes of [Fluid Framework version
    2.0.0-internal.7.0.0](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/releases/tag/client_v2.0.0-internal.7.0.0) for details
    on the replacements.

-   container-definitions: Added containerMetadata prop on IContainer interface ([#19142](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/issues/19142)) [d0d77f3516](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/d0d77f3516d67f3c9faedb47b20dbd4e309c3bc2)

    Added `containerMetadata` prop on IContainer interface.

-   runtime-definitions: Moved ISignalEnvelope interface to core-interfaces ([#19142](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/issues/19142)) [d0d77f3516](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/d0d77f3516d67f3c9faedb47b20dbd4e309c3bc2)

    The `ISignalEnvelope` interface has been moved to the @fluidframework/core-interfaces package.

## 2.0.0-rc.1.0.0

### Minor Changes

### Major Changes

-   odsp-driver: Load container in readonly mode when driver throws DriverErrorType.outOfStorage [871b3493dd](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/871b3493dd0d7ea3a89be64998ceb6cb9021a04e)

    Handle DriverErrorType.outOfStorage error from driver and load the container in readonly mode. Currently there is no
    handling and when the join session throws this error, the container will get closed. With this we use NoDeltaStream
    object as connection and load the container in read mode, so that it loads properly. We also notify the that the
    container is "readonly" through the event on delta manager so that apps can listen to this and show any UX etc. The app
    can listen to the event like this:

    ```ts
    container.deltaManager.on(
    	"readonly",
    	(readonly?: boolean, readonlyConnectionReason?: { text: string; error?: IErrorBase }) => {
    		// error?.errorType will be equal to DriverErrorType.outOfStorage in this case
    		// App logic
    	},
    );
    ```

-   Dependencies on @fluidframework/protocol-definitions package updated to 3.0.0 [871b3493dd](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/871b3493dd0d7ea3a89be64998ceb6cb9021a04e)

    This included the following changes from the protocol-definitions release:

    -   Updating signal interfaces for some planned improvements. The intention is split the interface between signals
        submitted by clients to the server and the resulting signals sent from the server to clients.
        -   A new optional type member is available on the ISignalMessage interface and a new ISentSignalMessage interface has
            been added, which will be the typing for signals sent from the client to the server. Both extend a new
            ISignalMessageBase interface that contains common members.
    -   The @fluidframework/common-definitions package dependency has been updated to version 1.0.0.

-   Server upgrade: dependencies on Fluid server packages updated to 2.0.1 [871b3493dd](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/871b3493dd0d7ea3a89be64998ceb6cb9021a04e)

### Major Changes

-   combineAppAndProtocolSummary removed from driver-utils [8abce8cdb4](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/8abce8cdb4e2832fb6405fb44e393bef03d5648a)

    combineAppAndProtocolSummary was deprecated in 2.0.0-internal.3.4.0 and has now been removed.

-   Upgraded typescript transpilation target to ES2020 [8abce8cdb4](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/8abce8cdb4e2832fb6405fb44e393bef03d5648a)

    Upgraded typescript transpilation target to ES2020. This is done in order to decrease the bundle sizes of Fluid Framework packages. This has provided size improvements across the board for ex. Loader, Driver, Runtime etc. Reduced bundle sizes helps to load lesser code in apps and hence also helps to improve the perf.If any app wants to target any older versions of browsers with which this target version is not compatible, then they can use packages like babel to transpile to a older target.
