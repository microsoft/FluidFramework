/**
 * In the lifetime of a container, the connection will likely disconnect and reconnect periodically.
 * This class ensures that any ops sent by this container instance on previous connection are either
 * sequenced or blocked by the server before emitting the new "connected" event and allowing runtime to resubmit ops.
 *
 * Each connection is assigned a clientId by the service, and the connection is book-ended by a Join and a Leave op
 * generated by the service. Due to the distributed nature of the Relay Service, in the case of reconnect we cannot
 * make any assumptions about ordering of operations between the old and new connections - i.e. new Join op could
 * be sequenced before old Leave op (and some acks from pending ops that were in flight when we disconnected).
 *
 * The job of this class is to encapsulate the transition period during reconnect, which is identified by
 * ConnectionState.CatchingUp. Specifically, before moving to Connected state with the new clientId, it ensures that:
 *
 * a. We process the Leave op for the previous clientId. This allows us to properly handle any acks from in-flight ops
 * that got sequenced with the old clientId (we'll recognize them as local ops). After the Leave op, any other
 * pending ops can safely be submitted with the new clientId without fear of duplication in the sequenced op stream.
 *
 * b. We process the Join op for the new clientId (identified when the underlying connection was first established),
 * indicating the service is ready to sequence ops sent with the new clientId.
 *
 * c. We process all ops known at the time the underlying connection was established (so we are "caught up")
 *
 * For (a) we give up waiting after some time (same timeout as server uses), and go ahead and transition to Connected.
 *
 * For (b) we log telemetry if it takes too long, but still only transition to Connected when the Join op/signal is
 * processed.
 *
 * For (c) this is optional behavior, controlled by the parameters of receivedConnectEvent
