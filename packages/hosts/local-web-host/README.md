# @fluidframework/local-web-host

This package allows hosting a container, or Fluid object on a webpage running against a local in-memory server.

The primary use cases for this package for displaying Fluid object demos in documentation, which illustrate their behavior, without connecting to a server.

See the example.html for an example of how this is done.

See [GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework) for more details on the Fluid Framework and packages within.
