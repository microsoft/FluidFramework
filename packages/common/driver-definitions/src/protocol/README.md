## Types for Fluid REST and Websocket APIs

The types defined in this directory provide strong typing for the deserialized
REST and WebSocket payloads when communicating with the Fluid service.

These should not be changed unless the Fluid service itself is changed, and
should be aligned with the service side definitions contained here:

common/lib/protocol-definitions

## Notes

The file names in this directory align with those in the common/lib to facilitate
copying/synchronization in the future, if desireable.
