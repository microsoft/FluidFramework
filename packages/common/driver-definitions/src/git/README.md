## Types for GIT REST API

The types defined in this directory provide strong typing for the deserialized
REST payloads when communicating with the Git service.

These should not be changed unless Git itself is changed, and should be aligned
with the service side definitions contained here:

server/routerlicious/packages/gitresources

## Notes

The file names in this directory align with those in the server/routerlicious
to facilitate copying/synchronization in the future, if desireable.
