 * The maximumCacheDurationMs policy represents an important interop mechanism between the driver layer
 * and the runtime layer.  The driver layer owns using the snapshot cache. Meanwhile the runtime layer
 * runs Garbage Collection, which requires that the max age of snapshots is constrained in order to reliably
 * compute when an object cannot possibly be referenced anymore and should be deleted.
 * To protect against data loss, the runtime will close the container if it finds the value of
 * maximumCacheDurationMs has changed (specifically, grown) in the lifetime of a file.
 *
 * So changing the type restrictions on this policy will likely lead to locking users out of existing documents.
