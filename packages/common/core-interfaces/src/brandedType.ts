/**
 * Base branded type which can be used to annotate other type.
 *
 * @remarks
 * To use, derive another class declaration and ideally add additional private
 * and or protected (generally preferred) properties to distinguish the type.
 * A private constructor is recommended to seal the brand class.
 *
 * `BrandedType` is covariant over its type parameter, which could be leveraged
 * for any generic type, but the preferred pattern is to specify variance
 * explicitly in the derived class. It convenient to have the derived class be
 * the generic given to `BrandedType`.
 *
 * Since branded types are not real value types, they will always need to be
 * created using `as` syntax and often `as unknown` first.
 *
 * This class should never exist at runtime, so it is only declared.
 *
 * @example
 * Definition of two branded types with different variance:
 * ```typescript
 * // A brand that is covariant over given T
 * declare class CovariantBrand<T> extends BrandedType<CovariantBrand<unknown>> {
 *    // Does not allow unrelated or less derived CovariantBrand-ed types to be
 *    // assigned. CovariantBrand<string> is not assignable to CovariantBrand<"literal">.
 *    protected readonly CovariantBrand: T;
 *    private constructor();
 * }
 * // A brand that is contravariant over given T
 * declare class ContravariantBrand<T> extends BrandedType<ContravariantBrand<unknown>> {
 *    // Does not allow unrelated or more derived ContravariantBrand-ed types to be
 *    // assigned. ContravariantBrand<"literal"> is not assignable to ContravariantBrand<string>.
 *    protected readonly ContravariantBrand: (_: T) => void;
 *    private constructor();
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Applying a brand to a type through type-guard:
 * ```typescript
 * function numberIs5(n: number): n is number & CovariantBrand<5> {
 *    return n === 5;
 * }
 * function onlyAccept4_5_or_6(_n: number & CovariantBrand<4 | 5 | 6>): void {}
 *
 * function example(n: number) {
 *    if (numberIs5(n)) {
 *       onlyAccept4_5_or_6(n); // OK: CovariantBrand<5> is assignable to CovariantBrand<4 | 5 | 6>;
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * @sealed
 * @internal
