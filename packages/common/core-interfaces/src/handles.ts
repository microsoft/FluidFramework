 * @privateRemarks
 * Normally `Symbol` would be used here instead of `Symbol.for` since just using Symbol (and avoiding the global symbol registry) removes the risk of collision, which is the main point of using a symbol for this in the first place.
 * In this case however, some users of this library do dynamic code loading, and can end up with multiple versions of packages, and mix data from one version with another.
 * Using the global symbol registry allows duplicate copies of this library to share a single symbol, though reintroduces the risk of collision, which is mitigated via the use of a UUIDv4 randomly generated when this code was authored:
