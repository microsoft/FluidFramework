	 * This API is experimental.

	 * Reconnection process will have these phases:
	 * 1. Establishing connection phase:
	 * - new connection clientId is added to member's list. That said, self.clientId still reflects old information.
	 * - The old client's information is removed from members' list. getMember(self.clientId) will return undefined.
	 * 2. Catch-up phase. Client catches up on latest ops and becomes current.
	 * 3. "connect" phase - the following happens synchronously:
	 * - getSelf() information changes to reflect new connection
	 * - "selfChanged" event on this object fires
	 * - Various API surfaces may expose "connected" event. This event fires at the same time as self changes. That said, "connected" event will not fire at ContainerRuntime layer if container is read-only.
	 *
	 * That said, at the moment this is an experimental API. It depends on some experimental settings that might change in the future.
	 * Events described in phase #3 may not happen at the same time if kill-bit feature gates are engaged due to a bug discovered in new logic
	 * that delivers this functionality. Once it's proven (at scale) that everything works well, experimental tag will be removed.
	 * Also application that deploy loader & container runtime bundles independently will see new (synchronized) behavior only when loader changes are deployed.
	 * Newer runtimes will continue to observe old (non-synchronized) behavior when paired with older loader code.
	 *
	 * When promises in phase #3 are broken (due to conditions described above), consumers could experience current clientId being changed
	 * (and "selfChanged" event fired) while
	 * 1. Such clientId is not present in Audience
	 * 2. Client is not fully caught up
