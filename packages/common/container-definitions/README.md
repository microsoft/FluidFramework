# @fluidframework/container-definitions

This package contains the interfaces and types concerning the Loader and loading the Container.

Some important interfaces in here include:

-   **ILoader, IContainer** - Interfaces allowing the Host to load and interact with a Container
-   **IContainerContext** - Proxy between the Host and the running instance of a Container,
    which allows the code supporting the running Container to be swapped out during a session.
-   **IRuntime / IRuntimeFactory** - Contract necessary for the ContainerContext to "boot" a Container at runtime.
-   **IDeltaManager / IDeltaQueue** - Abstraction over the Container's view of the ops being transmitted to/from storage.

## Using Fluid Framework libraries

When taking a dependency on a Fluid Framework library, we recommend using a `^` (caret) version range, such as `^1.3.4`.
While Fluid Framework libraries may use different ranges with interdependencies between other Fluid Framework libraries,
library consumers should always prefer `^`.
