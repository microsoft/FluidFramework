### Major Changes

-   data-object-base: Removed IFluidRouter from DataObject interfaces and classes [9a451d4946](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/9a451d4946b5c51a52e4d1ab5bf51e7b285b0d74)

    The `IFluidRouter` property has been removed from a number of DataObject related classes:

    -   `PureDataObject`
    -   `LazyLoadedDataObject`
    -   `TestFluidObject`

    Please migrate to the new `entryPoint` pattern or use the relevant `request` method as necessary.

### Major Changes

-   Dependencies on @fluidframework/protocol-definitions package updated to 3.0.0 [871b3493dd](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/871b3493dd0d7ea3a89be64998ceb6cb9021a04e)

    This included the following changes from the protocol-definitions release:

    -   Updating signal interfaces for some planned improvements. The intention is split the interface between signals
        submitted by clients to the server and the resulting signals sent from the server to clients.
        -   A new optional type member is available on the ISignalMessage interface and a new ISentSignalMessage interface has
            been added, which will be the typing for signals sent from the client to the server. Both extend a new
            ISignalMessageBase interface that contains common members.
    -   The @fluidframework/common-definitions package dependency has been updated to version 1.0.0.

-   Server upgrade: dependencies on Fluid server packages updated to 2.0.1 [871b3493dd](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/871b3493dd0d7ea3a89be64998ceb6cb9021a04e)

-   test-utils: provideEntryPoint is required [871b3493dd](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/871b3493dd0d7ea3a89be64998ceb6cb9021a04e)

    The optional `provideEntryPoint` method has become required on a number of constructors. A value will need to be provided to the following classes:

    -   `BaseContainerRuntimeFactory`
    -   `RuntimeFactory`
    -   `ContainerRuntime` (constructor and `loadRuntime`)
    -   `FluidDataStoreRuntime`

    See [testContainerRuntimeFactoryWithDefaultDataStore.ts](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/tree/main/packages/test/test-utils/src/testContainerRuntimeFactoryWithDefaultDataStore.ts) for an example implemtation of `provideEntryPoint` for ContainerRuntime.
    See [pureDataObjectFactory.ts](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/tree/main/packages/framework/aqueduct/src/data-object-factories/pureDataObjectFactory.ts#L83) for an example implementation of `provideEntryPoint` for DataStoreRuntime.

    Subsequently, various `entryPoint` and `getEntryPoint()` endpoints have become required. Please see [containerRuntime.ts](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/tree/main/packages/runtime/container-runtime/src/containerRuntime.ts) for example implementations of these APIs.

    For more details, see [Removing-IFluidRouter.md](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/blob/main/packages/common/core-interfaces/Removing-IFluidRouter.md)

-   Minimum TypeScript version now 5.1.6 [871b3493dd](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/871b3493dd0d7ea3a89be64998ceb6cb9021a04e)

    The minimum supported TypeScript version for Fluid 2.0 clients is now 5.1.6.

### Major Changes

-   Request APIs deprecated from many places [8abce8cdb4](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/8abce8cdb4e2832fb6405fb44e393bef03d5648a)

    The `request` API (associated with the `IFluidRouter` interface) has been deprecated on a number of classes and interfaces. The following are impacted:

    -   `IRuntime` and `ContainerRuntime`
    -   `IFluidDataStoreRuntime` and `FluidDataStoreRuntime`
    -   `IFluidDataStoreChannel`
    -   `MockFluidDataStoreRuntime`
    -   `TestFluidObject`

    Please migrate usage to the corresponding `entryPoint` or `getEntryPoint()` of the object. The value for these "entryPoint" related APIs is determined from factories (for `IRuntime` and `IFluidDataStoreRuntime`) via the `initializeEntryPoint` method. If no method is passed to the factory, the corresponding `entryPoint` and `getEntryPoint()` will be undefined.

    For an example implementation of `initializeEntryPoint`, see [pureDataObjectFactory.ts](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/blob/next/packages/framework/aqueduct/src/data-object-factories/pureDataObjectFactory.ts#L84).

    More information of the migration off the request pattern, and current status of its removal, is documented in [Removing-IFluidRouter.md](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/blob/main/packages/common/core-interfaces/Removing-IFluidRouter.md).

-   TestFluidObject.load removed [8abce8cdb4](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/8abce8cdb4e2832fb6405fb44e393bef03d5648a)

    TestFluidObject.load performed unsafe initialization, and has instead been replaced by direct usage of the constructor plus a call to testFluidObject.initialize(). This should have no impact to your scenario, as instantiation of TestFluidObjects should only be done through TestFluidObjectFactory.

-   EventAndErrorTrackingLogger is no longer a TelemetryLogger [8abce8cdb4](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/8abce8cdb4e2832fb6405fb44e393bef03d5648a)

    TelemetryLogger was deprecated and has now been removed, so EventAndErrorTrackingLogger can no longer inherit from it. EventAndErrorTrackingLogger is now a ITelemetryBaseLogger, to get an ITelemetryLogger, or ITelemetryLoggerExt call createChildLogger and pass in the EventAndErrorTrackingLogger as the logger property.

-   Upgraded typescript transpilation target to ES2020 [8abce8cdb4](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/8abce8cdb4e2832fb6405fb44e393bef03d5648a)

    Upgraded typescript transpilation target to ES2020. This is done in order to decrease the bundle sizes of Fluid Framework packages. This has provided size improvements across the board for ex. Loader, Driver, Runtime etc. Reduced bundle sizes helps to load lesser code in apps and hence also helps to improve the perf.If any app wants to target any older versions of browsers with which this target version is not compatible, then they can use packages like babel to transpile to a older target.

### Major Changes

-   ensureSynchronizedWithTimeout removed from LoaderContainerTracker [8b242fdc79](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/8b242fdc796714cf1da9ad3f90d02efb122af0c2)

    In @fluidframework/test-utils, `LoaderContainerTracker.ensureSynchronizedWithTimeout` has been removed, as it is
    equivalent to `LoaderContainerTracker.ensureSynchronized`. The `timeoutDuration` parameter from
    `TestObjectProvider.ensureSynchronized` has also been removed. Configure the timeout for the test instead.
