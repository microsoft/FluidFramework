### Major Changes

-   Request APIs deprecated from many places [8abce8cdb4](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/8abce8cdb4e2832fb6405fb44e393bef03d5648a)

    The `request` API (associated with the `IFluidRouter` interface) has been deprecated on a number of classes and interfaces. The following are impacted:

    -   `IRuntime` and `ContainerRuntime`
    -   `IFluidDataStoreRuntime` and `FluidDataStoreRuntime`
    -   `IFluidDataStoreChannel`
    -   `MockFluidDataStoreRuntime`
    -   `TestFluidObject`

    Please migrate usage to the corresponding `entryPoint` or `getEntryPoint()` of the object. The value for these "entryPoint" related APIs is determined from factories (for `IRuntime` and `IFluidDataStoreRuntime`) via the `initializeEntryPoint` method. If no method is passed to the factory, the corresponding `entryPoint` and `getEntryPoint()` will be undefined.

    For an example implementation of `initializeEntryPoint`, see [pureDataObjectFactory.ts](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/blob/next/packages/framework/aqueduct/src/data-object-factories/pureDataObjectFactory.ts#L84).

    More information of the migration off the request pattern, and current status of its removal, is documented in [Removing-IFluidRouter.md](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/blob/main/packages/common/core-interfaces/Removing-IFluidRouter.md).

-   TestFluidObject.load removed [8abce8cdb4](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/8abce8cdb4e2832fb6405fb44e393bef03d5648a)

    TestFluidObject.load performed unsafe initialization, and has instead been replaced by direct usage of the constructor plus a call to testFluidObject.initialize(). This should have no impact to your scenario, as instantiation of TestFluidObjects should only be done through TestFluidObjectFactory.

-   EventAndErrorTrackingLogger is no longer a TelemetryLogger [8abce8cdb4](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/8abce8cdb4e2832fb6405fb44e393bef03d5648a)

    TelemetryLogger was deprecated and has now been removed, so EventAndErrorTrackingLogger can no longer inherit from it. EventAndErrorTrackingLogger is now a ITelemetryBaseLogger, to get an ITelemetryLogger, or ITelemetryLoggerExt call createChildLogger and pass in the EventAndErrorTrackingLogger as the logger property.

-   Upgraded typescript transpilation target to ES2020 [8abce8cdb4](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/8abce8cdb4e2832fb6405fb44e393bef03d5648a)

    Upgraded typescript transpilation target to ES2020. This is done in order to decrease the bundle sizes of Fluid Framework packages. This has provided size improvements across the board for ex. Loader, Driver, Runtime etc. Reduced bundle sizes helps to load lesser code in apps and hence also helps to improve the perf.If any app wants to target any older versions of browsers with which this target version is not compatible, then they can use packages like babel to transpile to a older target.

### Major Changes

-   ensureSynchronizedWithTimeout removed from LoaderContainerTracker [8b242fdc79](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/8b242fdc796714cf1da9ad3f90d02efb122af0c2)

    In @fluidframework/test-utils, `LoaderContainerTracker.ensureSynchronizedWithTimeout` has been removed, as it is
    equivalent to `LoaderContainerTracker.ensureSynchronized`. The `timeoutDuration` parameter from
    `TestObjectProvider.ensureSynchronized` has also been removed. Configure the timeout for the test instead.
