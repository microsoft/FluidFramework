 * 2. In these tests, summarization is disabled on the main container. However, when the first summarizer container
 * is closed, the main container is still chosen as the summarizer due to a bug. If we reconnect a new summarizer
 * after this happens, it will be chosen as the summarizer client and can do on-demand summaries.
