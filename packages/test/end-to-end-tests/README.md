# @fluid-internal/end-to-end-tests

These tests can be written by using the [test-utils](../test-utils/src).

Check out the test-utils [README](../test-utils/README.md) that outlines how to write a test.

## Example
Take a look at the [SharedStringEndToEndTest](src/test/sharedStringEndToEndTests.spec.ts) for a basic example of how to write an end-to-end test.

The other tests in the same [directory](src/test) has more complex examples too.
