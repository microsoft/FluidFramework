# @fluid-internal/test-gc-sweep-tests

## Overview

The goal of these tests is to enable testing of the GC sweep infrastructure. Ideally, these tests should run for a few
minutes. This test is trying to imitate what might actually happen in the real world and provide enough randomness that
it will likely catch issues before they reach out to customers.

## Work in progress

Currently this package is still under development and may experience drastic changes.

## Build and Run for this test package

- `npm run test:build`
