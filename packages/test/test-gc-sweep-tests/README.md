# @fluid-internal/test-gc-sweep-tests

## Overview

The goal of these tests is to enable testing of the GC sweep infrastructure. Ideally, these tests should run for a few minutes. This test is trying to imitate what might actually happen in the real world and provide enough randomness that it will likely catch any sort of regression or bug missed by more targetted end-to-end tests.

## Work in progress

Currently this package is still under development and may experience drastic changes.
