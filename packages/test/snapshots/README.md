# @fluid-internal/test-snapshots

The snapshot tests primarily validate compatibility of Fluidframework with older snapshot format, i.e., snapshots that were generated by older versions of Fluidframework runtime work correctly with the current version. Examples of some of the tests:
- Load older snapshots with current version of container and validate the load is successful.
- Load older snapshots with current version of container, take new snapshots and validate the snapshots are in the current snapshot format.
- Messages generated by an older container are replayed to a container running current version. At some intervals during replay, snapshots are taken and validated that they are correct.

A list of old snapshots are stored in [FluidFrameworkTestData](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFrameworkTestData) repo which is a submodule of Fluidframework repo under the `content` folder. The sub-folders under `snapshotTestContent` represent snapshots generated by a container with content that helps validate compatibility of different functionalities.
For example, `SharedMatrixDeletes` has snapshots that where delete operations were performed on the `SharedMatrix` DDS and it validates the compatibility of this functionality.

For each of these sub-folders, snapshots with older versions are stored under `src_snapshots` and snapshots with current (or latest) version are stored under `current_snapshots`.

Note that the snapshots under `src_snapshots` are stored under folders whose name represent the runtime version that generated these snapshots. Every time the snapshot format changes, the current snapshot are moved to `src_snapshots` under the current runtime version number and the new snapshots are stored in `current_snapshots`.

For example, snapshots under `/SharedMatrixDeletes/src_snapshots/0.58.1000` were generated by runtime version `0.58.1000`. Now, lets say that the snapshot format changes in runtime version `X.0.0`. The snapshots under `/SharedMatrixDeletes/current_snapshots` will move to `/SharedMatrixDeletes/src_snapshots/X.0.0` and the new snapshots will be stored in the `current_snapshots` folder.

## Syncing snapshot tests content
The snapshots are stored in the [FluidFrameworkTestData](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFrameworkTestData) which is a submodule of Fluidframework repo. Run the following command to download / sync the snapshots:

```
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

This will pull all the content down to enable running the snapshot tests. The content will be under the `content` subdirectory.

You can run the tests by running the following command:

```
npm run test
```

## Submit changes to test content
For submitting changes to the snapshot test content, follow these steps:
- Submitting the changes to the test content:
  - Sync the content for the snapshot tests as mentioned [here](#Syncing-snapshot-tests-content).
  - Go to the `content` subdirectory, create a new branch and update the snapshot content. Ideally, you should not update the content manually but follow one of these:
    - [Adding new snapshots](#Adding-new-snapshots-to-the-repo) - If you are adding new snapshots.
    - [Updating existing snapshots](#Updating-existing-snapshots-in-the-repo) - If you updating existing snapshots.
  - Create a commit and push the new branch.
  - Create a PR against `main` branch in the [FluidFrameworkTestData](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFrameworkTestData) repo. Ensure the build passes, get the changes approved and merge the PR.
  - Checkout `main` branch of FluidFrameworkTestData repo, i.e., in the `content/` folder and run `git pull` to ensure it has your new changes.
- Updating FluidFramework repo to point to the new content:
  - Go to the FluidFramework repo root. Now you can run `git submodule update --init --recursive` in repo root to sync your changes with the newly updated test repo.
  - `git status` should show changes under `packages/test/snapshots/content`. For example:
  ```
  D:\FluidFramework>git status
  On branch updateTestSnapshots
  Your branch is up to date with 'origin/updateTestSnapshots'.

  Changes not staged for commit:
    (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
    (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
          modified:   packages/test/snapshots/content (new commits)

  no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")

  D:\FluidFramework>
  ```
  - Commit these changes to a new branch in the [FluidFramework](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework) repo. Since the main branch of the `FluidFrameworkTestData` repo was updated, the submodule commit hash needs to be updated to reflect that. 
  - Create a PR against `main`, get the changes approved and merge the PR. FluidFramework repo will now point to the new test contents.

## Adding new snapshots to the repo
To add new reference snapshots to the repo for a document, follow tests steps:
- Use the [fetch-tool](../../tools/fetch-tool/README.md) tool to fetch and save the snapshots and ops for the document.
- Create a folder for the new snapshots under [snapshotTestContent](./content/snapshotTestContent).
- Add the `message.json` file from the output of the [fetch-tool](../../tools/fetch-tool/README.md) to the new folder.
- Create a sub-folder called `base_snapshot`. From the output of the [fetch-tool](../../tools/fetch-tool/README.md), add the contents of the oldest snapshot (except `tree-original.json` and `decoded` folder).
  - The downloaded snapshots are in folders whose names are in format `<number>-<versionId>`. The oldest snapshot is in a folder that starts with the highest `number`.
  - Following is an example output of [fetch-tool](../../tools/fetch-tool/README.md):
    ```
    C:\snapshots>dir

    There are two snapshots in folders `0-bB8gBAAAHAAAA` and `1-bBwAAAAAHAAAA`. The oldest snapshot folder is `1-bBwAAAAAHAAAA` whose contents are:
    ```

    Copy everything in this folder except `tree-original.json` and `decode` to the `base_snapshot` directory created above.
- Scrub the newly added files of PII manually by replacing your id, your name, your email, and any other PII.
  - A shortcut you can use is right-click and `Find in Folder...`.
  - Feel free to use any replaced names, emails, and ids already in the files.
  - There is a tool in `packages\drivers\debugger\src\sanitize.ts` that can be applied to one file at a time.
- Run the following from the `packages\test\snapshots` directory:
  ```
  npm run test:new
  ```
  This will generate the snapshots for this based on the current version of the runtime. These new snapshots will be under `current_snapshots` directory.
- Run the tests to validate that all the tests pass with the new snapshots.
- Submit the changes by following the steps [here](#Submit-changes-to-test-content).

## Updating existing snapshots in the repo
Whenever the snapshot format changes in the runtime, the existing snapshots in the repo needs to be updated by following these steps:
- Run the following from the `packages\test\snapshots` directory:
  ```
  npm run test:update
  ```
  This will save the current snapshots in the `src_snapshots\<current_snapshots_version>` directory. It will then update the current snapshots under the `current_snapshots` directory to the new format.
- However, there is a chance that not all the snapshots will be updated. You will see this as a failure in the Azure build, which will indicate which files contain snapshots that were not updated. The failures might have to do with the same property/value and is likely present in all the files within that subdirectory. To solve this, do the following:
  -  Note the files in which the snapshot tests were failing and manually update them to reflect the expected assertion.
  -  Commit your changes in a new branch and push your changes.
  -  Ensure the CI test stages in the Azure build pipeline passes.
     -  To do this, temporarily change the branch in the `.gitmodules` file to point to the new branch in `FluidFrameworkTestData` you just pushed.
     -  Navigate to the root folder of the FluidFramework repo and run `npm run ci:test`.
- Run the tests to validate that all the tests pass with the new snapshots.
  - Don't forget to always stay updated with main and reinstall and build if necessary.
- Submit the changes by following the steps [here](#Submit-changes-to-test-content).
