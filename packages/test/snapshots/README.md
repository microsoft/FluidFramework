# @fluid-internal/test-snapshots

If it is the first time you are syncing the content for the snapshot tests, you need to do the following:
- Make sure you have "git lfs" installed.
- Run the following command:

    `git submodule update --init --recursive`

This will pull all the content down to enable running the snapshot tests.
