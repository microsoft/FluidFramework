# @fluidframework/runtime-definitions

Contains handshake interfaces for communication between the container runtime layer and the data store runtime layer.

- `IFluidDataStoreRuntimeChannel` includes the minimal set of data and functionalities that are needed by the ContainerRuntime to bind and control a FluidDataStoreRuntime, including attach, snapshot, op/signal processing, request routes, and connection state notifications.
- `IFluidDataStoreContext` includes data and function provided by the container layer and used by the data store layer for information about the container, to send ops and signals, data store creation, etc.
- Agent/Task related interfaces, since the agent scheduler is included by default by the container layer, and data stores can make use of it
- `IFluidDataStoreFactory` and `IFluidDataStoreRegistry` definitions
- Common protocol structures that are not related to back-compat between the layer: `IAttachMessage`, `IEnvelop`, `ISignalEnvelop`, `IInboundSignalMessage`.
- `IContainerRuntimeBase` is a temporary interface that includes a reduced set of data and functionalities from `IContainerRuntime` that the IFluidDataStoreRuntimeChannel or data store writer will need from `ContainerRuntime`.Eventually, all of the these should be shim by the `IFluidDataStoreContext`

These interfaces needs to have strong back-compat guaranetee to support dynamic data store loading scenario where the FluidDataStoreRuntime might be built with different version.
