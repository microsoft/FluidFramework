/**
 * A distributed UUID generator and compressor.
 *
 * Generates arbitrary non-colliding v4 UUIDs, called stable IDs, for multiple "sessions" (which can be distributed across the network),
 * providing each session with the ability to map these UUIDs to `numbers`.
 *
 * A session is a unique identifier that denotes a single compressor. New IDs are created through a single compressor API
 * which should then sent in ranges to the server for total ordering (and are subsequently relayed to other clients). When a new ID is
 * created it is said to be created by the compressor's "local" session.
 *
 * For each stable ID created, two numeric IDs are provided by the compressor:
 *
 * 1. A session-local ID, which is stable for the lifetime of the session (which could be longer than that of the compressor object, as it may
 * be serialized for offline usage). Available as soon as the stable ID is allocated. These IDs are session-unique and are thus only
 * safely usable within the scope of the compressor that created it.
 *
 * 2. A final ID, which is stable across serialization and deserialization of an IdCompressor. Available as soon as the range containing
 * the corresponding session-local ID is totally ordered (via consensus) with respect to other sessions' allocations.
 * Final IDs are known to and publicly usable by any compressor that has received them.
 *
 * Compressors will allocate UUIDs in non-random ways to reduce entropy allowing for optimized storage of the data needed
 * to map the UUIDs to the numbers.
 *
 * The following invariants are upheld by IdCompressor:
 *
 * 1. Session-local IDs will always decompress to the same UUIDs for the lifetime of the session.
 *
 * 2. Final IDs will always decompress to the same UUIDs.
 *
 * 3. After a server-processed range of session-local IDs (from any session) is received by a compressor, any of those session-local IDs may be
 * translated by the compressor into the corresponding final ID. For any given session-local ID, this translation will always yield the
 * same final ID.
 *
 * 4. A UUID will always compress into the same session-local ID for the lifetime of the session.
 *
 * Session-local IDs are sent across the wire in efficiently-represented ranges. These ranges are created by querying the compressor, and *must*
 * be ordered (i.e. sent to the server) in the order they are created in order to preserve the above invariants.
 *
 * Session-local IDs can be used immediately after creation, but will eventually (after being sequenced) have a corresponding final ID. This
 * could make reasoning about equality of those two forms difficult. For example, if a cache is keyed off of a
 * session-local ID but is later queried using the final ID (which is semantically equal, as it decompresses to the same UUID/string) it will
 * produce a cache miss. In order to make using collections of both remotely created and locally created IDs easy, regardless of whether the
 * session-local IDs have been finalized, the compressor defines two "spaces" of IDs:
 *
 * 1. Session space: in this space, all IDs are normalized to their "most local form". This means that all IDs created by the local session
 * will be in local form, regardless of if they have been finalized. Remotely created IDs, which could only have been received after
 * finalizing and will never have a local form for the compressor, will of course be final IDs. This space should be used with consumer APIs
 * and data structures, as the lifetime of the IDs is guaranteed to be the same as the compressor object. Care must be taken to not use
 * these IDs across compressor objects, as the local IDs are specific to the compressor that created them.
 *
 * 2. Op space: in this space, all IDs are normalized to their "most final form". This means that all IDs except session-local IDs that
 * have not yet been finalized will be in final ID form. This space is useful for serialization in ops (e.g. references), as other clients
 * that receive them need not do any work to normalize them to *their* session-space in the common case. Note that IDs in op space may move
 * out of Op space over time, namely, when a session-local ID in this space becomes finalized, and thereafter has a "more final form".
 * Consequentially, it may be useful to restrict parameters of a persisted type to this space (to optimize perf), but it is potentially
 * incorrect to use this type for a runtime variable. This is an asymmetry that does not affect session space, as local IDs are always as
 * "local as possible".
 *
 * These two spaces naturally define a rule: consumers of compressed IDs should use session-space IDs, but serialized forms such as ops
 * should use op-space IDs.
