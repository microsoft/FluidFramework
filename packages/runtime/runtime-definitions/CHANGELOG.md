### Major Changes

-   Dependencies on @fluidframework/protocol-definitions package updated to 3.0.0 [871b3493dd](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/871b3493dd0d7ea3a89be64998ceb6cb9021a04e)

    This included the following changes from the protocol-definitions release:

    -   Updating signal interfaces for some planned improvements. The intention is split the interface between signals
        submitted by clients to the server and the resulting signals sent from the server to clients.
        -   A new optional type member is available on the ISignalMessage interface and a new ISentSignalMessage interface has
            been added, which will be the typing for signals sent from the client to the server. Both extend a new
            ISignalMessageBase interface that contains common members.
    -   The @fluidframework/common-definitions package dependency has been updated to version 1.0.0.

-   runtime-definitions: `bindToContext` API removed [871b3493dd](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/871b3493dd0d7ea3a89be64998ceb6cb9021a04e)

    `bindToContext` has been removed from `FluidDataStoreRuntime`, `IFluidDataStoreContext` and
    `MockFluidDataStoreContext`. This has been deprecated for several releases and cannot be used anymore.

-   DEPRECATED: resolveHandle and IFluidHandleContext deprecated on IContainerRuntime [871b3493dd](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/871b3493dd0d7ea3a89be64998ceb6cb9021a04e)

    The `resolveHandle(...)` and `get IFluidHandleContext()` methods have been deprecated on the following interfaces:

    -   `IContainerRuntime`
    -   `IContainerRuntimeBase`

    Requesting arbitrary URLs has been deprecated on `IContainerRuntime`. Please migrate all usage to the `IContainerRuntime.getEntryPoint()` method if trying to obtain the application-specified root object.

    See [Removing-IFluidRouter.md](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/blob/main/packages/common/core-interfaces/Removing-IFluidRouter.md) for more details.

-   container-definitions: IContainer's and IDataStore's IFluidRouter capabilities are deprecated [871b3493dd](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/871b3493dd0d7ea3a89be64998ceb6cb9021a04e)

    `IFluidRouter` and `request({ url: "/" })` on `IContainer` and `IDataStore` are deprecated and will be removed in a future major release. Please migrate all usage to the appropriate `getEntryPoint()` or `entryPoint` APIs.

    See [Removing-IFluidRouter.md](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/blob/main/packages/common/core-interfaces/Removing-IFluidRouter.md) for more details.

    The optional `provideEntryPoint` method has become required on a number of constructors. A value will need to be provided to the following classes:

    -   `BaseContainerRuntimeFactory`
    -   `RuntimeFactory`
    -   `ContainerRuntime` (constructor and `loadRuntime`)
    -   `FluidDataStoreRuntime`

    See [testContainerRuntimeFactoryWithDefaultDataStore.ts](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/tree/main/packages/test/test-utils/src/testContainerRuntimeFactoryWithDefaultDataStore.ts) for an example implemtation of `provideEntryPoint` for ContainerRuntime.
    See [pureDataObjectFactory.ts](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/tree/main/packages/framework/aqueduct/src/data-object-factories/pureDataObjectFactory.ts#L83) for an example implementation of `provideEntryPoint` for DataStoreRuntime.

    Subsequently, various `entryPoint` and `getEntryPoint()` endpoints have become required. Please see [containerRuntime.ts](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/tree/main/packages/runtime/container-runtime/src/containerRuntime.ts) for example implementations of these APIs.

    For more details, see [Removing-IFluidRouter.md](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/blob/main/packages/common/core-interfaces/Removing-IFluidRouter.md)

## 2.0.0-internal.6.0.0

### Major Changes

-   Request APIs deprecated from many places [8abce8cdb4](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/8abce8cdb4e2832fb6405fb44e393bef03d5648a)

    The `request` API (associated with the `IFluidRouter` interface) has been deprecated on a number of classes and interfaces. The following are impacted:

    -   `IRuntime` and `ContainerRuntime`
    -   `IFluidDataStoreRuntime` and `FluidDataStoreRuntime`
    -   `IFluidDataStoreChannel`
    -   `MockFluidDataStoreRuntime`
    -   `TestFluidObject`

    Please migrate usage to the corresponding `entryPoint` or `getEntryPoint()` of the object. The value for these "entryPoint" related APIs is determined from factories (for `IRuntime` and `IFluidDataStoreRuntime`) via the `initializeEntryPoint` method. If no method is passed to the factory, the corresponding `entryPoint` and `getEntryPoint()` will be undefined.

    For an example implementation of `initializeEntryPoint`, see [pureDataObjectFactory.ts](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/blob/next/packages/framework/aqueduct/src/data-object-factories/pureDataObjectFactory.ts#L84).

    More information of the migration off the request pattern, and current status of its removal, is documented in [Removing-IFluidRouter.md](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/blob/main/packages/common/core-interfaces/Removing-IFluidRouter.md).

-   IContainer's and IDataStore's IFluidRouter capabilities are deprecated. [8abce8cdb4](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/8abce8cdb4e2832fb6405fb44e393bef03d5648a)

    -   The `request` function taking an arbitrary URL and headers is deprecated
    -   However, an overload taking only `{ url: "/" }` is not, for back-compat purposes during the migration
        from the request pattern to using entryPoint.

    ### About requesting "/" and using entryPoint

    Requesting "/" is an idiom some consumers of Fluid Framework have used in their own `requestHandler`s
    (passed to `ContainerRuntime.loadRuntime` and `FluidDataStoreRuntime`'s constructor).
    The ability to access the "root" or "entry point" of a Container / DataStore will presently be provided by
    `IContainer.getEntryPoint` and `IDataStore.entryPoint`. However these are still optional, so a temporary workaround is needed.

    See [Removing-IFluidRouter.md](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/blob/main/packages/common/core-interfaces/Removing-IFluidRouter.md)
    for more info on this transition from request to entryPoint.

    ### Present Replacement for requesting an arbitrary URL

    Suppose you have these variables:

    ```ts
    const container: IContainer = ...;
    const dataStore: IDataStore = ...;
    ```

    Before:

    ```ts
    container.request({ url, headers });
    dataStore.request({ url, headers });
    ```

    After:

    ```ts
    // Assume there is an interface like this in the app's Container implementation
    interface CustomUrlRouter {
    	doRequestRouting(request: { url: string; headers: Record<string, any>; }): any;
    }

    // Prerequisite: Pass a requestHandler to ContainerRuntime.loadRuntime that routes "/"
    // to some root object implementing CustomUrlRouter
    const containerRouter: CustomUrlRouter = await container.request({ "/" });
    containerRouter.doRequestRouting({ url, headers });

    // Prerequisite: Pass a requestHandler to FluidDataStoreRuntime's constructor that routes "/"
    // to some root object implementing CustomUrlRouter
    const dataStoreRouter: CustomUrlRouter = await dataStore.request({ "/" });
    dataStoreRouter.doRequestRouting({ url, headers });
    ```

    ### Looking ahead to using entryPoint

    In the next major release, `getEntryPoint` and `entryPoint` should be mandatory and available for use.
    Then you may replace each call `request({ url: "/" })` with a call to get the entryPoint using these functions/properties.

-   Upgraded typescript transpilation target to ES2020 [8abce8cdb4](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/8abce8cdb4e2832fb6405fb44e393bef03d5648a)

    Upgraded typescript transpilation target to ES2020. This is done in order to decrease the bundle sizes of Fluid Framework packages. This has provided size improvements across the board for ex. Loader, Driver, Runtime etc. Reduced bundle sizes helps to load lesser code in apps and hence also helps to improve the perf.If any app wants to target any older versions of browsers with which this target version is not compatible, then they can use packages like babel to transpile to a older target.

-   IDeltaManager members disposed and dispose() removed [8abce8cdb4](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/8abce8cdb4e2832fb6405fb44e393bef03d5648a)
