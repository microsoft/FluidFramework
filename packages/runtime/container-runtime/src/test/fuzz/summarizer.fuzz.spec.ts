/**
 * Summarizer fuzz test should test that we eventually recover and send a summary successfully.
 * For DDS, we test for eventual consistency. For summarizer, we could test for eventual recovery.
 * After performing operations (i.e. disconnects, summaryNacks, ops from other clients, etc.) we should:
 * - start a fresh summarizer
 * - attempt a summary
 * If the system doesn't recover properly, then we have a bug to fix.
