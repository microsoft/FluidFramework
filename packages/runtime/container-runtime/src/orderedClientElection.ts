     * OrderedClientCollection tracks electedClient and electedParent separately. This allows us to handle the case

     * a new summarizer should not yet be spawned. In this case, changing electedParent will cause SummaryManager
     * to stop the current summarizer, but a new summarizer will not be spawned until the old summarizer client has
     * left the quorum.
     *
     * Details:
     *
     * electedParent is the interactive client that has been elected to spawn a summarizer. It is typically the oldest
     * eligible interactive client in the quorum. Only the electedParent is permitted to spawn a summarizer.
     * Once elected, this client will remain the electedParent until it leaves the quorum or the summarizer that
     * it spawned stops producing summaries, at which point a new electedParent will be chosen.
     *
     * electedClient is the non-interactive summarizer client if one exists. If not, then electedClient is equal to
     * electedParent. If electedParent === electedClient, this is the signal for electedParent to spawn a new
     * electedClient. Once a summarizer client becomes electedClient, a new summarizer will not be spawned until
     * electedClient leaves the quorum.
     *
     * A typical sequence looks like this:
     *
     * i. Begin by electing A. electedParent === A, electedClient === A.
     *
     * ii. SummaryManager running on A spawns a summarizer client, A'. electedParent === A, electedClient === A'
     *
     * iii. A' stops producing summaries. A new parent client, B, is elected. electedParent === B, electedClient === A'
     *
     * iv. SummaryManager running on A detects the change to electedParent and tells the summarizer to stop, but A'
     * is in mid-summarization. No new summarizer is spawned, as electedParent !== electedClient.
     *
     * v. A' completes its summary, and the summarizer and backing client are torn down.
     *
     * vi. A' leaves the quorum, and B takes its place as electedClient. electedParent === B, electedClient === B
     *
     * vii. SummaryManager running on B spawns a summarizer client, B'. electedParent === B, electedClient === B'
