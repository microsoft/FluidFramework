/**
 * Controller of document schema.
 *
 * Recommended pre-reading: https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/blob/main/packages/dds/SchemaVersioning.md
 *
 * This class manages current document schema and transitions between document schemas.
 * At the moment, it only focuses on subset of document schema, specifically - how FluidFramework runtime serializes data
 * (summary and op format), features & capabilities that a version of runtime has to support and understand in
 * order to collaborate on a document.
 * New features that modify document format have to be included in document schema definition.
 * Usage of such features could only happen after document schema has been updated to reflect such feature.
 *
 * This formality allows clients that do not understand such features to fail right away when they observe
 * document schema listing capabilities that such client does not understand.
 * Old clients will fail in predictable way. This allows us to
 * 1) Immediately see such issues and adjust if features are enabled too early, before changes have been saturated.
 * 2) There is no way to get to 100% saturation with new code. Even if we have 99.99% saturation, there are
 *    still 0.01% of clients who will fail. Failing early and predictably ensures they have no chance to limp along
 *    and potentially corrupt the document. This is especially true for summarizer client, who could simply "undo"
 *    changes it does not understands.
 *
 * It's important to note how it overlaps with feature gates and safe velocity.
 * If new feature was in use, that resulted in a number of documents referencing such feature in document schema.
 * But, developers (through code deployment or feature gates) could disable usage of such features.
 * That will stop a process of further document schema changes (for documents that were not using such feature).
 * And documents that already list such capability in their schema will continue to do so. Later ensures that old
 * clients who do not understand such feature will continue to fail to open such documents, as such documents very
 * likely contain data in a new format.
 *
 * Controller operates with 4 schemas:
 * - document schema: whatever we loaded from summary metadata + ops. It follows eventuall consistency rules (i.e. like DDS).
 * - desired schema - what client is asking for to have (i.e. all the desired settings, based on runtime options / feature gates).
 * - session schema - current session schema. It's "and" of the above two schemas.
 * - future schema - "or" of document and desires schemas.
 *
 * "or" & "and" operators are defined individually for each property. For Boolean properties it's literally &&, || operators.
 * But for other properties it's more nuanced.
 *
 * Whenver document schema does not match future schema, controller will send an op that attempts to changs documents schema to
 * future schema.
 *
 * Users of this class need to use DocumentsSchemaController.sessionSchema to determine what features can be used.
 *
 * There are two modes this class can operate:
 * 1) Legacy mode. In such mode it does not issue any ops to change document schema. Any changes happen implicitly,
 *    right away, and new features are available right away
 * 2) Non-legacy mode. In such mode any changes to schema require an op roundtrip. This class will manage such transitions.
 *    However code should assume that any new features that were not enabled in a given document will not be available
 *    for a given session. That's because this session may never send any ops (including read-only documents). Or it may
 *    fail to convert schema.
 *    This class promises eventual movement forward. I.e. if new feature is allowed (let's say - through feature gates),
 *    then eventually all documents that are modified will have that feature reflected in their schema. It could require
 *    multiple reloads / new sessions to get there (depends on if code reacts to schema changes right away, or only consults
 *    schema on document load).
 *
 * How schemas are changed (in non-legacy mode):
 * If a client needs to change a schema, it will attempt to do so as part of normal ops sending process.
 * Changes happen in CAS (Compare-and-swap) fashion, i.e. client tells current schema and schema it wants to change to.
 * When a number of clients race to change a schema, then only one of them will win, all others will fail because they will
 * reference old schema that is no longer in effect.
 * Clients can retry, but current implementation is simply - they will not (and will rely on next session / reload to do
 * recalc and decide if schema needs to be changed or not).
