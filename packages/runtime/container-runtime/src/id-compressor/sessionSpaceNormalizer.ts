/**
 * The `SessionSpaceNormalizer` tracks the form of the IDs created by the local session.
 * More precisely, it acts as a set of all `LocalCompressedId`s created by the local session and allows querying whether a specific
 * ID was produced by the local session. This information can be used to determine whether the nth ID created by the local session
 * was produced as a local ID (negative) or a final ID (positive).
 *
 * The local and final forms of IDs made by a session can be thought of as two equal-length sparse arrays, aligned such
 * that normalizeLocalToFinal(locals[i]) === finals[i] and vice versa.
 * Below is an example to illustrate how various mappings can arise:
 *
 * ```
 *     +- Creation Index
 *    /     +- Locals
 *   /     /    +- Finals
 *  /     /    /
 * ---+-----+----
 * 0  | -1  | 0   -|___ Two IDs are allocated as locals since no cluster exists. A new cluster is created when acked.
 * 1  | -2  | 1   -|
 * 2  |     | 2   -|
 * 3  |     | 3   --|-- Three more IDs are allocated as finals eagerly since a cluster exists with available capacity.
 * 4  |     | 4   -|
 * 5  | -6  | 10  ----- One ID is allocated as a local (it overflows the existing cluster) and a new cluster is created after ack.
 * 6  |     | 11  ----- This ID (and the subsequent few) is allocated eagerly as a final ID into the existing cluster.
 * 7  |     | 12
 * 8  |     | 13
 * 9  |     | 14
 * 10 | -11 |     ----- The cluster is out of room, so a local ID is allocated. It has no corresponding final ID since it has not been acked.
 * ```
 *
 * This class stores the set of local IDs and thus their indices, as local IDs are essentially negative offsets from the first ID.
 * The form (local or final) of a given ID index (for example, the 5th ID made by the local session) can be deduced from this information.
