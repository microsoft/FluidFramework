 * However, this is not consistent with today's behavior. Some options (i.e.
 * batching, compression) are enabled by default despite not being compatible
 * with 1.x clients. Since the policy was introduced during 2.x's lifespan,
 * N/N-1 compatibility by **default** will be in effect starting with 3.0.
 * Importantly though, N/N-2 compatibility is still guaranteed with the proper
 * configurations set.
 *
 * Further to distinguish unspecified `compatibilityVersion` from a specified
 * version and allow `enableExplicitSchemaControl` to default to `true` for
 * any 2.0.0+ version, we will use a special value of `2.0.0-defaults`, which
 * is semantically less than 2.0.0.
