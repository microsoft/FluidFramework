## Using Fluid Framework libraries

For a dependency on a Fluid Framework library's public APIs, we recommend a `^` (caret) version range.
For example, use `^1.3.4`.

For a dependency on an unstable API, such as a `beta` API, we recommend a more restrictive version range.
For example, use a `~` version range.

## Installation

Run this command to install the package:

```bash
npm i @fluidframework/container-runtime
```

## Importing from this package

This package uses [package.json exports](https://nodejs.org/api/packages.html#exports) to separate APIs by support level.
For information about the support guarantees, read [API Support Levels](https://fluidframework.com/docs/build/releases-and-apitags/#api-support-levels).

Import the `public` APIs from `@fluidframework/container-runtime`.

Import the `legacy` APIs from `@fluidframework/container-runtime/legacy`.

## API Documentation

## Data Virtualization For DataStores (Work in Progress)

It's a capability to exclude some content from initial snapshot (used when loading container) and thus improve boot
performance of a container. Excluded content could be loaded at a later time when it's required.

### Motivation for Data Virtualization

This section talks about how the system used to work before Data virtualization. Currently, the content of whole file
is downloaded in one go. Due to limitation of data virtualization, FF holds all blobs in snapshot as those might be
required in the future. Any delayed loading (through FF APIs) results in loading state of datastores at a sequence
number of snapshot we booted from, up until the current sequence number by applying the pending ops for that datastore.
While application may choose not to load some data stores immediately on boot (and realize some saving in time and
memory by not allocating appropriate app state for such datastores), FF still pays the costs for such content. It also
continues to pay the cost for all such content indefinitely, even if those datastores were loaded.

### Improvement with Data Virtualization

With this, we will provide a capability to:

-   Exclude some sub-trees from snapshot payload, thus allowing faster transfer times / boot times and smaller initial
    memory footprint.
-   Ability to delay-load data stores later.

Container Runtime Apis like IContainerRuntimeBase.createDataStore and IContainerRuntimeBase.createDetachedDataStore
provides an argument `loadingGroupId` which allows apps to mark a datastore at time of creation currently. Every data
store is assigned a groupID. Not providing groupID (on API) means that default ID is used. This groupId represents the
group of the datastore within a container or its snapshot. When a container is loaded initially, only datastores which
belongs to default group are fetched from service and can be loaded on demand when requested by user. This decreases
the amount of data which needs to be fetched during load and hence provides faster boot times for the container.
Attempting to load any datastore within a non-default group results in fetching all content/datastores marked with same
groupId. So, one network will be required to fetch content for a group when a datastore from a group is requested by an
application.
In advanced app scenarios, app would want to make datastores with a specific group Id, based on how it wants to load a
certain group at once, and not load the datastores that aren't part of the group. By effectively using groupID, app
will be able to improve boot times by not fetching unnecessary groups at load.
So to summarize, when datastore is assigned to a group, content of such data store will not be loaded with initial load
of container. It will be loaded only when any datastore with such groupID is realized.
This will improve the boot perf. Data virtualization or providing the `loadingGroupId` will however decrease the
performance of loading of those datastores as one network call would be required before loading. However,
providing same `loadingGroupId` to put some data stores in same group, would improve performance for their loading as
compared to providing a different group Id to each of these datastores as then one network call will be required to
fetch snapshot for that group of datastores rather than one network call for each datastore. So, the datastores which
can get fairly big in size content wise and which are not required to be loaded on boot, can be put under a non-default
groupId.

## Minimum Client Requirements

Fluid Framework client libraries support the platforms in this document.
These requirements are intentionally restrictive.
Within a major version series, we can relax these requirements, but we cannot make them stricter.
For a Long Term Support (LTS) version, we might need to support these platforms for several years.

Other configurations can work, but Fluid Framework does not support them.
If an unsupported configuration stops working, we do not classify this as a bug.
To request support for a configuration that is not listed, file an issue.
The product team will evaluate your request.
In the issue, specify the current status of the configuration:

-   The configuration works but needs official support.
-   The configuration does not work and requires changes.

### Supported Runtimes

-   Fluid Framework supports Node.js versions 22 and 24 while they receive [upstream support](https://nodejs.org/en/about/previous-releases).
    -   Fluid Framework will stop support for version 22 [when upstream support ends on 2027-04-30](https://github.com/nodejs/release#release-schedule).
    -   Fluid Framework does not support Node.js with the `--no-experimental-fetch` flag.
-   Fluid Framework supports modern browsers that support the ES2022 standard library.

### Supported Tools

-   [TypeScript 6.0](https://typescriptdocs.com/release-notes/TypeScript%206.0):
    -   Fluid Framework supports all [`strict`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig) options.
    -   Set the build targets (`lib`, `target`) to `ES2022` or later.
    -   Enable [`strictNullChecks`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig).
    -   Fluid Framework does not support [configuration options deprecated in TypeScript 6.0](https://typescriptdocs.com/release-notes/TypeScript%206.0#breaking-changes-and-deprecations-in-typescript-6-0).
    -   Fluid Framework does not fully support `exactOptionalPropertyTypes`.
        If you enable this option, do not use `in`, `Reflect.has`, `Object.hasOwn`, or `Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty` to narrow members of Fluid Framework types.
        These methods can incorrectly exclude `undefined` from the possible values.
-   [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) 5
    -   We do not require a specific bundler.
        Other bundlers that handle ES Modules can work, but we actively test only webpack.

### Module Resolution

In TypeScript `compilerOptions`, use [`Node16`, `Node20`, `NodeNext`, or `Bundler`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#moduleResolution) module resolution.
These settings follow the [Node.js v12+ ESM Resolution and Loading algorithm](https://nodejs.github.io/nodejs.dev/en/api/v20/esm/#resolution-and-loading-algorithm).

Do not use `Node10` module resolution.

### Module Formats

-   ES Modules:
    Use ES Modules to consume Fluid Framework client packages, including in Node.js.
-   CommonJS:
    Fluid Framework does not officially support CommonJS in version 3.0 or later.
