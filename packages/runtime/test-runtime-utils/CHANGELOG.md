### Minor Changes

-   The createDataStoreWithProps APIs on ContainerRuntime and IContainerRuntimeBase have been removed ([#22996](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/pull/22996)) [bd243fb292](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/bd243fb2927915d87c42486e21ee0c990962a9a7)

    `ContainerRuntime.createDataStoreWithProps` and `IContainerRuntimeBase.createDataStoreWithProps`
    were [deprecated in version 0.25.0](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/blob/main/BREAKING.md#icontainerruntimebase_createdatastorewithprops-is-removed) and have been removed.

    Replace uses of these APIs with `PureDataObjectFactory.createInstanceWithDataStore` and pass in props via the `initialState`
    parameter.

    These changes were originally announced in version 0.25.0. See the following issues for more details:

### Minor Changes

-   "Remove `IFluidParentContext.ensureNoDataModelChanges` and its implementations ([#22842](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/pull/22842)) [3aff19a462](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/3aff19a4622a242e906286c14dfcfa6523175132)

    -   `IFluidParentContext.ensureNoDataModelChanges` has been removed. [prior deprecation commit](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/c9d156264bdfa211a3075bdf29cde442ecea234c)
    -   `MockFluidDataStoreContext.ensureNoDataModelChanges` has also been removed.

-   The inbound and outbound properties have been removed from IDeltaManager ([#22282](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/pull/22282)) [45a57693f2](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/45a57693f291e0dc5e91af7f29a9b9c8f82dfad5)

    The inbound and outbound properties were [deprecated in version 2.0.0-rc.2.0.0](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/blob/main/RELEASE_NOTES/2.0.0-rc.2.0.0.md#container-definitions-deprecate-ideltamanagerinbound-and-ideltamanageroutbound) and have been removed from `IDeltaManager`.

    `IDeltaManager.inbound` contained functionality that could break core runtime features such as summarization and processing batches if used improperly. Data loss or corruption could occur when `IDeltaManger.inbound.pause()` or `IDeltaManager.inbound.resume()` were called.

    Similarly, `IDeltaManager.outbound` contained functionality that could break core runtime features such as generation of batches and chunking. Data loss or corruption could occur when `IDeltaManger.inbound.pause()` or `IDeltaManager.inbound.resume()` were called.

    #### Alternatives

    -   Alternatives to `IDeltaManager.inbound.on("op", ...)` are `IDeltaManager.on("op", ...)`
    -   Alternatives to calling `IDeltaManager.inbound.pause`, `IDeltaManager.outbound.pause` for `IContainer` disconnect use `IContainer.disconnect`.
    -   Alternatives to calling `IDeltaManager.inbound.resume`, `IDeltaManager.outbound.resume` for `IContainer` reconnect use `IContainer.connect`.

## 2.5.0

### Minor Changes

-   The process function on IFluidDataStoreChannel, IDeltaHandler, MockFluidDataStoreRuntime and MockDeltaConnection is now deprecated ([#22840](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/pull/22840)) [2e5b969d3a](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/2e5b969d3a28b05da1502d521b725cee66e36a15)

    The process function on IFluidDataStoreChannel, IDeltaHandler, MockFluidDataStoreRuntime and MockDeltaConnection is now
    deprecated. It has been replaced with a new function `processMessages`, which will be called to process multiple messages instead of a single one on the channel. This is part of a feature called "Op bunching", where contiguous ops of a given type and to a given data store / DDS are bunched and sent together for processing.

    Implementations of `IFluidDataStoreChannel` and `IDeltaHandler` must now also implement `processMessages`. For reference implementations, see `FluidDataStoreRuntime::processMessages` and `SharedObjectCore::attachDeltaHandler`.

### Minor Changes

-   Update to TypeScript 5.4 ([#21214](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/pull/21214)) [0e6256c722](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/0e6256c722d8bf024f4325bf02547daeeb18bfa6)

    Update package implementations to use TypeScript 5.4.5.

-   Update to ES 2022 ([#21292](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/pull/21292)) [68921502f7](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/68921502f79b1833c4cd6d0fe339bfb126a712c7)

    Update tsconfig to target ES 2022.

## 2.0.0-rc.4.0.0

Dependency updates only.

## 2.0.0-rc.3.0.0

### Major Changes

-   Packages now use package.json "exports" and require modern module resolution [97d68aa06b](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/97d68aa06bd5c022ecb026655814aea222a062ae)

    Fluid Framework packages have been updated to use the [package.json "exports"
    field](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v18.x/api/packages.html#exports) to define explicit entry points for both
    TypeScript types and implementation code.

    This means that using Fluid Framework packages require the following TypeScript settings in tsconfig.json:

    -   `"moduleResolution": "Node16"` with `"module": "Node16"`
    -   `"moduleResolution": "Bundler"` with `"module": "ESNext"`

    We recommend using Node16/Node16 unless absolutely necessary. That will produce transpiled JavaScript that is suitable
    for use with modern versions of Node.js _and_ Bundlers.
    [See the TypeScript documentation](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#moduleResolution) for more information
    regarding the module and moduleResolution options.

    **Node10 moduleResolution is not supported; it does not support Fluid Framework's API structuring pattern that is used
    to distinguish stable APIs from those that are in development.**

## 2.0.0-rc.2.0.0

### Minor Changes

-   driver-definitions: repositoryUrl removed from IDocumentStorageService ([#19522](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/issues/19522)) [90eb3c9d33](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/90eb3c9d33d80e24caa1393a50f414c5602f6aa3)

    The `repositoryUrl` member of `IDocumentStorageService` was unused and always equal to the empty string. It has been removed.

-   container-definitions: ILoaderOptions no longer accepts arbitrary key/value pairs ([#19306](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/issues/19306)) [741926e225](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/741926e2253a161504ecc6a6451d8f15d7ac4ed6)

    ILoaderOptions has been narrowed to the specific set of supported loader options, and may no longer be used to pass arbitrary key/value pairs through to the runtime.

## 2.0.0-rc.1.0.0

### Minor Changes

-   Updated server dependencies ([#19122](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/issues/19122)) [25366b4229](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/25366b422918cb43685c5f328b50450749592902)

    The following Fluid server dependencies have been updated to the latest version, 3.0.0. [See the full changelog.](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/releases/tag/server_v3.0.0)

    -   @fluidframework/gitresources
    -   @fluidframework/server-kafka-orderer
    -   @fluidframework/server-lambdas
    -   @fluidframework/server-lambdas-driver

    -   @fluidframework/server-services-telemetry
    -   @fluidframework/server-services-utils
    -   @fluidframework/server-test-utils
    -   tinylicious

-   Updated @fluidframework/protocol-definitions ([#19122](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/issues/19122)) [25366b4229](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/25366b422918cb43685c5f328b50450749592902)

    The @fluidframework/protocol-definitions dependency has been upgraded to v3.1.0. [See the full
    changelog.](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/blob/main/common/lib/protocol-definitions/CHANGELOG.md#310)

-   garbage collection: Deprecate addedGCOutboundReference ([#18456](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/issues/18456)) [0619cf8a41](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/0619cf8a4197bee6d5ac56cac05db92008939817)

    The `addedGCOutboundReference` property on IDeltaConnection, IFluidDataStoreContext, and MockFluidDataStoreRuntime is
    now deprecated.

    The responsibility of adding outbound references (for Garbage Collection tracking) is moving up to the ContainerRuntime.
    Previously, DDSes themselves were responsible to detect and report added outbound references (via a handle being stored),
    so these interfaces (and corresponding mock) needed to plumb that information up to the ContainerRuntime layer where GC sits.
    This is no longer necessary so they're being removed in an upcoming release.

## 2.0.0-internal.8.0.0

### Major Changes

-   datastore-definitions: Jsonable and Serializable now require a generic parameter [9a451d4946](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/9a451d4946b5c51a52e4d1ab5bf51e7b285b0d74)

    The `Jsonable` and `Serializable` types from @fluidframework/datastore-definitions now require a generic parameter and
    if that type is `any` or `unknown`will return a new result `JsonableTypeWith<>` that more accurately represents the
    limitation of serialization.

    Additional modifications:

    -   `Jsonable`'s `TReplacement` parameter default has also been changed from `void` to `never`, which now disallows
        `void`.
    -   Unrecognized primitive types like `symbol` are now filtered to `never` instead of `{}`.
    -   Recursive types with arrays (`[]`) are now supported.

    `Serializable` is commonly used for DDS values and now requires more precision when using them. For example SharedMatrix
    (unqualified) has an `any` default that meant values were `Serializable<any>` (i.e. `any`), but now `Serializable<any>`
    is `JsonableTypeWith<IFluidHandle>` which may be problematic for reading or writing. Preferred correction is to specify
    the value type but casting through `any` may provide a quick fix.

-   test-runtime-utils: MockDeltaManager class property type changes [9a451d4946](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/9a451d4946b5c51a52e4d1ab5bf51e7b285b0d74)

    The `active` and `maxMessageSize` properties on the `MockDeltaManager` class have changed from property getters to
    `readonly` fields. While this is an API change, there should be no changes required on the consumer side since calling
    code should remain the same.

### Major Changes

-   Dependencies on @fluidframework/protocol-definitions package updated to 3.0.0 [871b3493dd](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/871b3493dd0d7ea3a89be64998ceb6cb9021a04e)

    This included the following changes from the protocol-definitions release:

    -   Updating signal interfaces for some planned improvements. The intention is split the interface between signals
        submitted by clients to the server and the resulting signals sent from the server to clients.
        -   A new optional type member is available on the ISignalMessage interface and a new ISentSignalMessage interface has
            been added, which will be the typing for signals sent from the client to the server. Both extend a new
            ISignalMessageBase interface that contains common members.
    -   The @fluidframework/common-definitions package dependency has been updated to version 1.0.0.

-   runtime-definitions: `bindToContext` API removed [871b3493dd](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/871b3493dd0d7ea3a89be64998ceb6cb9021a04e)

    `bindToContext` has been removed from `FluidDataStoreRuntime`, `IFluidDataStoreContext` and
    `MockFluidDataStoreContext`. This has been deprecated for several releases and cannot be used anymore.

-   Server upgrade: dependencies on Fluid server packages updated to 2.0.1 [871b3493dd](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/871b3493dd0d7ea3a89be64998ceb6cb9021a04e)

-   test-utils: provideEntryPoint is required [871b3493dd](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/871b3493dd0d7ea3a89be64998ceb6cb9021a04e)

    The optional `provideEntryPoint` method has become required on a number of constructors. A value will need to be provided to the following classes:

    -   `BaseContainerRuntimeFactory`
    -   `RuntimeFactory`
    -   `ContainerRuntime` (constructor and `loadRuntime`)
    -   `FluidDataStoreRuntime`

    See [testContainerRuntimeFactoryWithDefaultDataStore.ts](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/tree/main/packages/test/test-utils/src/testContainerRuntimeFactoryWithDefaultDataStore.ts) for an example implemtation of `provideEntryPoint` for ContainerRuntime.
    See [pureDataObjectFactory.ts](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/tree/main/packages/framework/aqueduct/src/data-object-factories/pureDataObjectFactory.ts#L83) for an example implementation of `provideEntryPoint` for DataStoreRuntime.

    Subsequently, various `entryPoint` and `getEntryPoint()` endpoints have become required. Please see [containerRuntime.ts](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/tree/main/packages/runtime/container-runtime/src/containerRuntime.ts) for example implementations of these APIs.

    For more details, see [Removing-IFluidRouter.md](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/blob/main/packages/common/core-interfaces/Removing-IFluidRouter.md)

-   Minimum TypeScript version now 5.1.6 [871b3493dd](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/871b3493dd0d7ea3a89be64998ceb6cb9021a04e)

    The minimum supported TypeScript version for Fluid 2.0 clients is now 5.1.6.

### Minor Changes

-   Remove use of @fluidframework/common-definitions ([#16638](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/issues/16638)) [a8c81509c9](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/a8c81509c9bf09cfb2092ebcf7265205f9eb6dbf)

    The **@fluidframework/common-definitions** package is being deprecated, so the following interfaces and types are now
    imported from the **@fluidframework/core-interfaces** package:

## 2.0.0-internal.6.0.0

### Major Changes

-   `MockContainerRuntime` and `MockFluidDataStoreRuntime` have new required methods [8abce8cdb4](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/8abce8cdb4e2832fb6405fb44e393bef03d5648a)

    `MockContainerRuntime` has two new required methods, `flush()` and `rebase()`. `MockFluidDataStoreRuntime` has one new required method, `createDeltaConnection`.

    To enable testing scenarios involving batches of ops, `MockContainerRuntime` has two new required methods, `flush()` and `rebase()`. Depending on the `IMockContainerRuntimeOptions` supplied to the mock runtime, these two new methods must be used accordingly. For the same reason, `MockFluidDataStoreRuntime` implements the `createDeltaConnection` method, along with managing the mock delta connection lifecycle in a single place.

-   Request APIs deprecated from many places [8abce8cdb4](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/8abce8cdb4e2832fb6405fb44e393bef03d5648a)

    The `request` API (associated with the `IFluidRouter` interface) has been deprecated on a number of classes and interfaces. The following are impacted:

    -   `IRuntime` and `ContainerRuntime`
    -   `IFluidDataStoreRuntime` and `FluidDataStoreRuntime`
    -   `IFluidDataStoreChannel`
    -   `MockFluidDataStoreRuntime`
    -   `TestFluidObject`

    Please migrate usage to the corresponding `entryPoint` or `getEntryPoint()` of the object. The value for these "entryPoint" related APIs is determined from factories (for `IRuntime` and `IFluidDataStoreRuntime`) via the `initializeEntryPoint` method. If no method is passed to the factory, the corresponding `entryPoint` and `getEntryPoint()` will be undefined.

    For an example implementation of `initializeEntryPoint`, see [pureDataObjectFactory.ts](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/blob/next/packages/framework/aqueduct/src/data-object-factories/pureDataObjectFactory.ts#L84).

    More information of the migration off the request pattern, and current status of its removal, is documented in [Removing-IFluidRouter.md](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/blob/main/packages/common/core-interfaces/Removing-IFluidRouter.md).

-   Upgraded typescript transpilation target to ES2020 [8abce8cdb4](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/8abce8cdb4e2832fb6405fb44e393bef03d5648a)

    Upgraded typescript transpilation target to ES2020. This is done in order to decrease the bundle sizes of Fluid Framework packages. This has provided size improvements across the board for ex. Loader, Driver, Runtime etc. Reduced bundle sizes helps to load lesser code in apps and hence also helps to improve the perf.If any app wants to target any older versions of browsers with which this target version is not compatible, then they can use packages like babel to transpile to a older target.

-   IDeltaManager members disposed and dispose() removed [8abce8cdb4](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/8abce8cdb4e2832fb6405fb44e393bef03d5648a)

    IDeltaManager members disposed and dispose() were deprecated in 2.0.0-internal.5.3.0 and have now been removed.
