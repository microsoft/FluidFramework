### Major Changes

-   container-runtime-definitions: Removed resolveHandle and IFluidHandleContext from ContainerRuntime interfaces [9a451d4946](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/9a451d4946b5c51a52e4d1ab5bf51e7b285b0d74)

    The `IContainerRuntime.resolveHandle(...)` method and the `IContainerRuntimeBase.IFluidHandleContext` property have been
    removed. Please remove all usage of these APIs.

    See
    [Removing-IFluidRouter.md](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/blob/main/packages/common/core-interfaces/Removing-IFluidRouter.md)
    for more details.

-   container-runtime-definitions: Removed getRootDataStore [9a451d4946](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/9a451d4946b5c51a52e4d1ab5bf51e7b285b0d74)

    The `getRootDataStore` method has been removed from `IContainerRuntime` and `ContainerRuntime`. Please migrate all usage to the new `getAliasedDataStoreEntryPoint` method. This method returns the data store's entry point which is its `IFluidHandle`.

### Major Changes

-   Dependencies on @fluidframework/protocol-definitions package updated to 3.0.0 [871b3493dd](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/871b3493dd0d7ea3a89be64998ceb6cb9021a04e)

    This included the following changes from the protocol-definitions release:

    -   Updating signal interfaces for some planned improvements. The intention is split the interface between signals
        submitted by clients to the server and the resulting signals sent from the server to clients.
        -   A new optional type member is available on the ISignalMessage interface and a new ISentSignalMessage interface has
            been added, which will be the typing for signals sent from the client to the server. Both extend a new
            ISignalMessageBase interface that contains common members.
    -   The @fluidframework/common-definitions package dependency has been updated to version 1.0.0.

-   container-runtime-definitions: `IDataStoreWithBindToContext_Deprecated` interface removed [871b3493dd](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/871b3493dd0d7ea3a89be64998ceb6cb9021a04e)

    `IDataStoreWithBindToContext_Deprecated` has been removed. It has been deprecated for a while and cannot be used anymore.

-   DEPRECATED: resolveHandle and IFluidHandleContext deprecated on IContainerRuntime [871b3493dd](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/871b3493dd0d7ea3a89be64998ceb6cb9021a04e)

    The `resolveHandle(...)` and `get IFluidHandleContext()` methods have been deprecated on the following interfaces:

    -   `IContainerRuntime`
    -   `IContainerRuntimeBase`

    Requesting arbitrary URLs has been deprecated on `IContainerRuntime`. Please migrate all usage to the `IContainerRuntime.getEntryPoint()` method if trying to obtain the application-specified root object.

    See [Removing-IFluidRouter.md](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/blob/main/packages/common/core-interfaces/Removing-IFluidRouter.md) for more details.

### Major Changes

-   `getRootDataStore` API is deprecated [8abce8cdb4](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/8abce8cdb4e2832fb6405fb44e393bef03d5648a)

    The `getRootDataStore` API that is used to get aliased data store has been deprecated. It will be removed in a future release.
    Use `getAliasedDataStoreEntryPoint` API to get aliased data stores instead. It returns the data store's entry point which is its `IFluidHandle`. To use this API `initializeEntryPoint` must be provided when creating `FluidDataStoreRuntime` [here](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/blob/main/packages/runtime/datastore/src/dataStoreRuntime.ts#L243). `getAliasedDataStoreEntryPoint` and `initializeEntryPoint` will become required in a future release.

-   Upgraded typescript transpilation target to ES2020 [8abce8cdb4](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/8abce8cdb4e2832fb6405fb44e393bef03d5648a)

    Upgraded typescript transpilation target to ES2020. This is done in order to decrease the bundle sizes of Fluid Framework packages. This has provided size improvements across the board for ex. Loader, Driver, Runtime etc. Reduced bundle sizes helps to load lesser code in apps and hence also helps to improve the perf.If any app wants to target any older versions of browsers with which this target version is not compatible, then they can use packages like babel to transpile to a older target.

-   IDeltaManager members disposed and dispose() removed [8abce8cdb4](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/8abce8cdb4e2832fb6405fb44e393bef03d5648a)

    IDeltaManager members disposed and dispose() were deprecated in 2.0.0-internal.5.3.0 and have now been removed.
