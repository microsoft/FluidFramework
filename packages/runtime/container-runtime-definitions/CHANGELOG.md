### Major Changes

-   `getRootDataStore` API is deprecated [8abce8cdb4](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/8abce8cdb4e2832fb6405fb44e393bef03d5648a)

    The `getRootDataStore` API that is used to get aliased data store has been deprecated. It will be removed in a future release.
    Use `getAliasedDataStoreEntryPoint` API to get aliased data stores instead. It returns the data store's entry point which is its `IFluidHandle`. To use this API `initializeEntryPoint` must be provided when creating `FluidDataStoreRuntime` [here](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/blob/main/packages/runtime/datastore/src/dataStoreRuntime.ts#L243). `getAliasedDataStoreEntryPoint` and `initializeEntryPoint` will become required in a future release.

-   Upgraded typescript transpilation target to ES2020 [8abce8cdb4](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/8abce8cdb4e2832fb6405fb44e393bef03d5648a)

    Upgraded typescript transpilation target to ES2020. This is done in order to decrease the bundle sizes of Fluid Framework packages. This has provided size improvements across the board for ex. Loader, Driver, Runtime etc. Reduced bundle sizes helps to load lesser code in apps and hence also helps to improve the perf.If any app wants to target any older versions of browsers with which this target version is not compatible, then they can use packages like babel to transpile to a older target.
