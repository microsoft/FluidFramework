/**
 * Brand for value that has not been verified.

 * @remarks
 * What element is unverified is left up to the user and should be
 * coordinated with and documented for associated logic.
 *
 * One type of unverified data is whether a `string` represents an identifier
 * known to the system, such as an email address. This unverified email address
 * could be represented as `string & UnverifiedBrand<EmailAddress>` where
 * `EmailAddress` is a branded type for email addresses, such as
 * `string & BrandedType<"EmailAddress">`.
 *
 * Another type of unverified data is particular structure of value where little
 * to no or weak structure is known. An example is data received over the
 * wire that is expected to be of a certain structure but has not yet been
 * verified.
 *
 * Usage where value (type `U`) is not yet verified to be type `T`:
 *
 * - Cast value of type `U` suspected/expected to be `T` but not verified (where
 * `T extends U`) to `UnverifiedBrand` using `as U & UnverifiedBrand<T>`. An
 * example base type `U` for an object is `Record<string, unknown>`.
 *
 * - When `T` value is needed, use narrowing type guards to check (preferred)
 * or cast from `UnverifiedBrand` using `as unknown` when "instance" must
 * be parsed to `T`.
 *
 * @example Example narrowing type guard:
 * ```typescript
 * function validateFoo(
 *   unverified: Foo | (Record<string, unknown> & UnverifiedBrand<Foo>)
 * ): unverified is Foo {
 *   return unverified.IFooProvider === unverified;
 * }
