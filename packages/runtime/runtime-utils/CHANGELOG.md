# @fluidframework/runtime-utils

## 2.0.0-rc.2.0.0

### Minor Changes

-   container-runtime: New feature: ID compression for DataStores & DDSs ([#19859](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/issues/19859)) [51f0d3db73](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/51f0d3db737800e1c30ea5e3952d38ff30ffc7da)

    ### Key changes

    1. A new API IContainerRuntimeBase.generateDocumentUniqueId() is exposed. This API will opportunistically generate IDs in short format (non-negative numbers). If it can't achieve that, it will return UUID strings. UUIDs generated will have low entropy in groups and will compress well. It can be leveraged anywhere in container where container unique IDs are required. I.e. any place that uses uuid() and stores data in container is likely candidate to start leveraging this API.
    2. Data store internal IDs (IDs that are auto generated by FF system) will opportunistically be generated in shorter form. Data stores created in detached container will always have short IDs, data stores created in attached container will opportunistically be short (by using newly added IContainerRuntimeBase.generateDocumentUniqueId() capability)
    3. Similar DDS names will be opportunistically short (same considerations for detached DDS vs. attached DDS)

    ### Implementation details

    1. Container level ID Compressor can now be enabled with delay. With such setting, only new IContainerRuntimeBase.generateDocumentUniqueId() is exposed (ID Compressor is not exposed in such case, as leveraging any of its other capabilities requires future container sessions to load ID Compressor on container load, for correctness reasons). Once Container establishes connection and any changes are made in container, newly added API will start generating more compact IDs (in most cases).

    ### Breaking changes

    1. DDS names can no longer start with "\_" symbol - this is reserved for FF needs. I've validated that's not an issue for AzureClient (it only creates root object by name, everything else is referred by handle). Our main internal partners almost never use named DDSs (I can find only 4 instances in Loop).

    ### Backward compatibility considerations

    1. Data store internal IDs could collide with earlier used names data stores. Earlier versions of FF framework (before DataStore aliasing feature was added) allowed customers to supply IDs for data stores. And thus, files created with earlier versions of framework could have data store IDs that will be similar to names FF will use for newly created data stores ("A", ... "Z", "a"..."z", "AA", etc.). While such collision is possible, it's very unlikely (almost impossible) if user-provided names were at least 4-5 characters long.
    2. If application runs to these problems, or wants to reduce risks, consider disabling ID compressor via IContainerRuntimeOptions.enableRuntimeIdCompressor = "off".

    ### Minor changes

    1. IContainerRuntime.createDetachedRootDataStore() is removed. Please use IContainerRuntime.createDetachedDataStore and IDataStore.trySetAlias() instead
    2. IContainerRuntimeOptions.enableRuntimeIdCompressor has been changes from boolean to tri-state.

    The @fluidframework/protocol-definitions dependency has been upgraded to v3.1.0. [See the full
    changelog.](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/blob/main/common/lib/protocol-definitions/CHANGELOG.md#310)

## 2.0.0-internal.8.0.0

### Major Changes

-   container-definitions: Fix ISnapshotTreeWithBlobContents and mark internal [9a451d4946](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/9a451d4946b5c51a52e4d1ab5bf51e7b285b0d74)

    `ISnapshotTreeWithBlobContents` is an internal type that should not be used externally. Additionally, the type didn't
    match the usage, specifically in runtime-utils where an `any` cast was used to work around undefined blobContents. The
    type has been updated to reflect that blobContents can be undefined.

-   runtime-utils: Removed requestFluidObject [9a451d4946](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/9a451d4946b5c51a52e4d1ab5bf51e7b285b0d74)

    The `requestFluidObject` utility has been removed. Please migrate all usage of it to the new `entryPoint` pattern.

### Major Changes

-   Dependencies on @fluidframework/protocol-definitions package updated to 3.0.0 [871b3493dd](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/871b3493dd0d7ea3a89be64998ceb6cb9021a04e)

    This included the following changes from the protocol-definitions release:

    -   Updating signal interfaces for some planned improvements. The intention is split the interface between signals
        submitted by clients to the server and the resulting signals sent from the server to clients.
        -   A new optional type member is available on the ISignalMessage interface and a new ISentSignalMessage interface has
            been added, which will be the typing for signals sent from the client to the server. Both extend a new
            ISignalMessageBase interface that contains common members.
    -   The @fluidframework/common-definitions package dependency has been updated to version 1.0.0.

-   DEPRECATED: container-loader: Various request related APIs have been deprecated [871b3493dd](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/871b3493dd0d7ea3a89be64998ceb6cb9021a04e)

    Please remove all calls to the following functions and instead use the new `entryPoint` pattern:

    -   `requestFluidObject`
    -   `requestResolvedObjectFromContainer`
    -   `getDefaultObjectFromContainer`
    -   `getObjectWithIdFromContainer`
    -   `getObjectFromContainer`

### Major Changes

-   Upgraded typescript transpilation target to ES2020 [8abce8cdb4](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/8abce8cdb4e2832fb6405fb44e393bef03d5648a)

    Upgraded typescript transpilation target to ES2020. This is done in order to decrease the bundle sizes of Fluid Framework packages. This has provided size improvements across the board for ex. Loader, Driver, Runtime etc. Reduced bundle sizes helps to load lesser code in apps and hence also helps to improve the perf.If any app wants to target any older versions of browsers with which this target version is not compatible, then they can use packages like babel to transpile to a older target.

-   Remove packagePathToTelemetryProperty Function [8abce8cdb4](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/8abce8cdb4e2832fb6405fb44e393bef03d5648a)

    packagePathToTelemetryProperty was previously deprecated and is now removed. Use tagCodeArtifacts instead.
