	// Run jest against pre-built JavaScript.
	// 1. ts-jest does not handle Node16 config and use of .cts files sufficiently. It
	//    is possible to run directly against the TypeScript source (<rootDir>/src),
	//    if tsconfig is changed to CommonJs+Bundler.
	// 2. ESNext+Bundler with "cross-env NODE_OPTIONS=--experimental-vm-modules" is also
	//    not sufficient to address .cts issues even with a patch to address
	//    https://github.com/kulshekhar/ts-jest/issues/3996.
	//
	// Two other options were not investigated:
	// A. expose internal/test exports for components directly tested here and use self-reference
	//    (see https://nodejs.org/api/packages.html#self-referencing-a-package-using-its-name),
	//    which should use the built package files (remove references in tsconfig for good
	//    measure).
	// B. Replace ts-jest with babel.
	//
	// It is good to run against the pre-built source as we know that we are testing exactly the
	// production source. Option A would allow dynamic test source and exact production results.
	// Testing against ESM is currently preferred and what is configured here.
	// From command line however, roots will be set to ./dist until fluentui has proper ESM support
	// in their dual-emit packages (see https://github.com/microsoft/fluentui/issues/30778).
