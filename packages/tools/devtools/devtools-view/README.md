# @fluid-internal/devtools-view

This library contains a simple view for visualizing data generated by Fluid Devtools.

This library also powers our [Chrome Extension](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/overview/): [@fluid-internal/devtools-browser-extension][].

## Usage

This library has 2 primary entry-points:

1. A React component: `DevtoolsPanel`.
2. An environment-agnostic rendering hook: TODO.

## Working in the package

### Build

To build the package locally, first ensure you have run `pnpm install` from the root of the mono-repo.
Next, to build the code, run `npm run build` from the root of the mono-repo, or use [fluid-build](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/tree/main/build-tools/packages/build-tools#running-fluid-build-command-line) via `fluid-build -t build`.

-   Note: Once you have run a build from the root, assuming no other changes outside of this package, you may run `npm run build` directly within this directory for a faster build.
    If you make changes to any of this package's local dependencies, you will need to run a build again from the root before building again from directly within this package.

### Testing

This package uses [jest](https://jestjs.io/) and [testing-library/react](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/)
to power its unit tests.
The corresponding test modules can be found under `src/test`.

To run only the unit tests, first ensure you have followed the [build](#build) steps above.
Next, run `npm run test:jest` from a terminal within this directory.

### Accessibility Best Practices

When developing components for this library, it's important to have accessibility in mind.
Here are some guidelines and best practices to ensure your components are accessible to all users:

1. Keyboard Navigation:
    - Ensure all interactive elements are reachable via keyboard navigation.
    Use the `tabIndex` attribute to control the tab order of elements.
    For example, setting `tabIndex="0"` will include an element in the natural tab order, while `tabIndex="-1"` will remove it from the tab order but still allow it to receive focus programmatically.
    - Ensure that components such as dropdowns, buttons, and links can be operated using the keyboard.
    Implement keyboard event handling (`onKeyDown`, `onKeyPress`) for actions like opening a dropdown with the "Enter" key or navigating between items with the arrow keys.
2. ARIA Attributes:
    - Use [ARIA](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA) (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) attributes to provide additional information about UI components to screen readers.
    For example, use `aria-label`, `aria-labelledby`, or `aria-describedby` to provide accessible names or descriptions.
    - For components like dropdowns or modal dialogs, consider using roles such as `role="menu"` and `role="dialog"` to convey the purpose of the elements to assistive technologies.
3. Color Contrast:
    - Ensure that the color contrast ratio between text and background is sufficient.
    Aim for a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1.
    You can use online tools to verify color contrast compliance with [WCAG](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/act/rules/09o5cg/proposed/) (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines).
