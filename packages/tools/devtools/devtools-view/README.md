# @fluid-internal/devtools-view

This library contains a simple view for visualizing data generated by Fluid Devtools.

This library also powers our [Chrome Extension](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/overview/): [@fluid-internal/devtools-browser-extension][].

<!-- AUTO-GENERATED-CONTENT:START (README_PACKAGE_SCOPE_NOTICE) -->

**IMPORTANT: This package is intended strictly as an implementation detail of the Fluid Framework and is not intended for public consumption.**
**We make no stability guarantees regarding its APIs.**

## Usage

This library has 2 primary entry-points:

1. A React component: `DevtoolsPanel`.
2. An environment-agnostic rendering hook: TODO.

## Working in the package

### Build

To build the package locally, first ensure you have run `pnpm install` from the root of the mono-repo.
Next, to build the code, run `npm run build` from the root of the mono-repo, or use [fluid-build](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/tree/main/build-tools/packages/build-tools#running-fluid-build-command-line) via `fluid-build -t build`.

-   Note: Once you have run a build from the root, assuming no other changes outside of this package, you may run `npm run build` directly within this directory for a faster build.
    If you make changes to any of this package's local dependencies, you will need to run a build again from the root before building again from directly within this package.

### Testing

This package uses [jest](https://jestjs.io/) and [testing-library/react](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/)
to power its unit tests.
The corresponding test modules can be found under `src/test`.

To run only the unit tests, first ensure you have followed the [build](#build) steps above.
Next, run `npm run test:jest` from a terminal within this directory.
