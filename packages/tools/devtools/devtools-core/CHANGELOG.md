## 2.0.0-internal.8.0.0

### Major Changes

-   datastore-definitions: Jsonable and Serializable now require a generic parameter [9a451d4946](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/9a451d4946b5c51a52e4d1ab5bf51e7b285b0d74)

    The `Jsonable` and `Serializable` types from @fluidframework/datastore-definitions now require a generic parameter and
    if that type is `any` or `unknown`will return a new result `JsonableTypeWith<>` that more accurately represents the
    limitation of serialization.

    Additional modifications:

    -   `Jsonable`'s `TReplacement` parameter default has also been changed from `void` to `never`, which now disallows
        `void`.
    -   Unrecognized primitive types like `symbol` are now filtered to `never` instead of `{}`.
    -   Recursive types with arrays (`[]`) are now supported.

    `Serializable` is commonly used for DDS values and now requires more precision when using them. For example SharedMatrix
    (unqualified) has an `any` default that meant values were `Serializable<any>` (i.e. `any`), but now `Serializable<any>`
    is `JsonableTypeWith<IFluidHandle>` which may be problematic for reading or writing. Preferred correction is to specify
    the value type but casting through `any` may provide a quick fix.

### Minor Changes

-   tree2: Rename "Value" Multiplicity and FieldKind ([#17622](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/issues/17622)) [bb68aeb30c](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/bb68aeb30cfb3d4e0e82f04f1771ad4cb69e23af)

    `Multiplicity.Value` has been renamed to `Multiplicity.Single` and `FieldKinds.value` has been renamed to `FieldKinds.required`.

### Major Changes

-   Dependencies on @fluidframework/protocol-definitions package updated to 3.0.0 [871b3493dd](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/871b3493dd0d7ea3a89be64998ceb6cb9021a04e)

    This included the following changes from the protocol-definitions release:

    -   Updating signal interfaces for some planned improvements. The intention is split the interface between signals
        submitted by clients to the server and the resulting signals sent from the server to clients.
        -   A new optional type member is available on the ISignalMessage interface and a new ISentSignalMessage interface has
            been added, which will be the typing for signals sent from the client to the server. Both extend a new
            ISignalMessageBase interface that contains common members.
    -   The @fluidframework/common-definitions package dependency has been updated to version 1.0.0.

-   Server upgrade: dependencies on Fluid server packages updated to 2.0.1 [871b3493dd](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/871b3493dd0d7ea3a89be64998ceb6cb9021a04e)

-   test-utils: provideEntryPoint is required [871b3493dd](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/871b3493dd0d7ea3a89be64998ceb6cb9021a04e)

    The optional `provideEntryPoint` method has become required on a number of constructors. A value will need to be provided to the following classes:

    -   `BaseContainerRuntimeFactory`
    -   `RuntimeFactory`
    -   `ContainerRuntime` (constructor and `loadRuntime`)
    -   `FluidDataStoreRuntime`

    See [testContainerRuntimeFactoryWithDefaultDataStore.ts](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/tree/main/packages/test/test-utils/src/testContainerRuntimeFactoryWithDefaultDataStore.ts) for an example implemtation of `provideEntryPoint` for ContainerRuntime.
    See [pureDataObjectFactory.ts](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/tree/main/packages/framework/aqueduct/src/data-object-factories/pureDataObjectFactory.ts#L83) for an example implementation of `provideEntryPoint` for DataStoreRuntime.

    Subsequently, various `entryPoint` and `getEntryPoint()` endpoints have become required. Please see [containerRuntime.ts](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/tree/main/packages/runtime/container-runtime/src/containerRuntime.ts) for example implementations of these APIs.

-   Minimum TypeScript version now 5.1.6 [871b3493dd](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/871b3493dd0d7ea3a89be64998ceb6cb9021a04e)

    The minimum supported TypeScript version for Fluid 2.0 clients is now 5.1.6.

    The **@fluidframework/common-definitions** package is being deprecated, so the following interfaces and types are now
    imported from the **@fluidframework/core-interfaces** package:

    -   interface IDisposable

### Major Changes

-   Upgraded typescript transpilation target to ES2020 [8abce8cdb4](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/8abce8cdb4e2832fb6405fb44e393bef03d5648a)

    Upgraded typescript transpilation target to ES2020. This is done in order to decrease the bundle sizes of Fluid Framework packages. This has provided size improvements across the board for ex. Loader, Driver, Runtime etc. Reduced bundle sizes helps to load lesser code in apps and hence also helps to improve the perf.If any app wants to target any older versions of browsers with which this target version is not compatible, then they can use packages like babel to transpile to a older target.
