This library contains developer tools for use alongside the Fluid Framework.
It is used to power our associated browser extensions.

## Usage

The Devtools' API surface is designed to fit nicely into most application flows.

### Initialization

To initialize a debugger session for your container, call `initializeDevtools`.
This function accepts a `DevtoolsLogger` for recording and communicating telemetry data, a list of initial Fluid `Containers` to associate with the session, and (optionally) customized data visualization configurations for visualizing `Container` data.

TODO: link to API docs once API shape has settled.

### Clean-up

The Devtools object is managed as a global singleton.
That singleton is automatically cleaned up prior to the Window's "unload" event.
So typical application flows likely won't need to worry about cleanup.
That said, if you wish to have tighter control over when the Devtools are torn down, you can simply call the `dispose` method on the handle returned by [initialization](#initialization).

## Related Tooling

This library is designed to work alongside our Chromium browser extension.

## Working in the package

### Build

To build the package locally, first ensure you have run `pnpm install` from the root of the mono-repo.
Next, to build the code, run `npm run build` from the root of the mono-repo, or use [fluid-build](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/tree/main/build-tools/packages/build-tools#running-fluid-build-command-line) via `fluid-build -s build`.

-   Note: Once you have run a build from the root, assuming no other changes outside of this package, you may run `npm run build` directly within this directory for a faster build.
    If you make changes to any of this package's local dependencies, you will need to run a build again from the root before building again from directly within this package.

### Test

To run the tests, first ensure you have followed the [build](#build) steps above.
Next, run `npm run test` from a terminal within this directory.
