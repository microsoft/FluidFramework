# @fluid-experimental/devtools-core

This library contains developer tools for use alongside the Fluid Framework.
It is used to power our associated [browser extension][browser-extension].

```bash
npm i @fluid-experimental/devtools-core -D
```

## Usage

The Devtools' API surface is designed to fit nicely into most application flows.

### Initialization

To initialize a devtools session for your container, call [`initializeDevtools`][initialize-devtools-docs].
This function accepts a `DevtoolsLogger` for receiving Fluid telemetry from your application, a list of initial Fluid
`Containers` to associate with the session, and (optionally) customized data visualization configurations for visualizing
`Container` data.

#### About the [`DevtoolsLogger`][devtools-logger-docs]

The `DevtoolsLogger` is an optional piece when calling `initializeDevtools` but it is strongly recommended that you use
it because several features in Fluid Devtools are powered by the telemetry that Fluid Framework generates, and this
logger is the way in which that telemetry gets into Fluid Devtools.

You can obtain a `DevtoolsLogger` by calling its constructor, and then should pass it to `initializeDevtools` _and_
to the `Loader` instance you'll use to create/load Containers as shown below.
This way the logger will receive all the telemetry generated by Fluid Framework in your application, and forward it to
Fluid Devtools as necessary.

```typescript
import { DevtoolsLogger, initializeDevtools } from "@fluid-experimental/devtools-core";

// Instantiate the logger
const devtoolsLogger = createDevtoolsLogger();

// Pass the logger when instantiating the Loader
const loader = new Loader({
	logger: devtoolsLogger,
	// Other necessary properties ...
});

// Use the Loader to create (and optionally, attach) a Container
const container = await loader.createDetachedContainer(/* params */);
await container.attach(/* params */);

// Initialize the Devtools passing the logger and your Container.
// The Container could be added later as well with devtools.registerContainerDevtools().
const devtools = initializeDevtools({
	logger: devtoolsLogger,
	initialContainers: [
		{
			container,
			containerKey: "My Container",
		},
	],
});
```

If you're working with `AzureClient` instead of lower-level APIs like the one described above, you probably want to
refer to the [@fluid-experimental/devtools package][devtools-package] instead of this one.

During local development the recommendation is that your application should receive the `DevtoolsLogger` instance _instead_
of any logger it would normally receive when deployed to a real environment, to avoid local development activity from
mixing with real telemetry.
If you still want to provide a real application logger and use the Fluid Devtools features that are powered by telemetry
at the same time, you can pass an existing logger to the `DevtoolsLogger` constructor and it will forward all telemetry
it receives to that logger as well:

```typescript
import { DevtoolsLogger } from "@fluid-experimental/devtools-core";

// Your application's logger
const yourApplicationLogger = getInstanceOfYourApplicationLogger();

const devtoolsLogger = createDevtoolsLogger(yourApplicationLogger);

// Pass devtoolsLogger to initializeDevtools() and to your application as described above
```

### Clean-up

The Devtools object is managed as a global singleton.
That singleton is automatically cleaned up prior to the Window's "unload" event.
So typical application flows likely won't need to worry about cleanup.
That said, if you wish to have tighter control over when the Devtools are torn down, you can simply call the `dispose` method on the handle returned by [initialization](#initialization).

## Contributing to the package

### Build

To build the package locally, first ensure you have run `pnpm install` from the root of the mono-repo.
Next, to build the code, run `npm run build` from the root of the mono-repo, or use [fluid-build](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/tree/main/build-tools/packages/build-tools#running-fluid-build-command-line) via `fluid-build -t build`.

-   Note: Once you have run a build from the root, assuming no other changes outside of this package, you may run `npm run build` directly within this directory for a faster build.
    If you make changes to any of this package's local dependencies, you will need to run a build again from the root before building again from directly within this package.

### Test

To run the tests, first ensure you have followed the [build](#build) steps above.
Next, run `npm run test` from a terminal within this directory.
