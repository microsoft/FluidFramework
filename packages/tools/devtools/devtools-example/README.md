# @fluid-example/devtools-example

This package contains a simple example application aimed at demonstrating how users can integrate [Fluid's developer tools]() into their applications.

Note: while this example is built using [React](), the developer tools are not specific to `React`; they should be compatible with the view framework of your choice.

## Getting Started

You can run this example using the following steps:

1. Enable [corepack](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v16.x/api/corepack.html) by running `corepack enable`.
1. Run `pnpm install` and `pnpm run build:fast --nolint` from the `FluidFramework` root directory.
    - For an even faster build, you can add the package name to the build command, like this:
      `pnpm run build:fast --nolint @fluid-example/devtools-example`
1. Run `pnpm start` from this directory and open <http://localhost:8080> in a web browser to see the app running.

This package uses pm2 to setup a cross-package hot reloading solution.
When you run `pnpm run start` it will start multiple processes with pm2.
pm2 is configured using the [pm2 ecosystem file](./pm2.ecosystem.config.js) and [pm2's offical documentation](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/docs/usage/quick-start/).
Here are a few helpful commands:

-   `pm2 list <name of app in pm2.ecosystem.config.js>` Shows all currently running processes managed by pm2 and the status they are in.
-   `pm2 log <name of app in pm2.ecosystem.config.js>` Shows the typical logs for a given process, what you'd expect to see if you started the app without pm2.
-   `pm2 delete <name of app in pm2.ecosystem.config.js>` Deletes a specific process managed by pm2
-   `pm2 delete all` Deletes all the processes managed by pm2

`pnpm run stop` will stop all the processes managed by pm2.
Use it when you're done testing this application so no processes are left in the background re-compiling the projects on every change.

### Test

To run the tests, first ensure you have followed the [build](#build) steps above.
Next, run `npm run test` from a terminal within this directory.
