# @fluid-internal/devtools-browser-extension

This package contains a browser (Chrome) developer tools extension for use with [@fluid-experimental/devtools][].
It offers visual insights into the workings of the Fluid Framework in your application.

It is currently compatible with [Chromium](https://www.chromium.org/Home/)-based browsers (e.g. [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) and [Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge/)).

## Artifacts

-   Chrome browser extension: <https://aka.ms/fluid/devtool/chrome>
-   Edge browser extension: <https://aka.ms/fluid/devtool/edge>

Note: this package does not generate any library artifacts, so it is marked as `private` in its `package.json`.

## Background

### Devtools Extensions

This package runs as a [Devtools Extension](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/devtools/) in Chromium-based browsers that support them.

For an overview on how Devtools extensions work, see [here](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/devtools/#content-script-to-devtools).

#### Initialization Flow

These details are covered by the above articles, but they are a bit obfuscated, so we'll elaborate here for clarity.

Background notes:

-   The `Background Script` is launched alongside the browser itself and runs for its lifetime.
    -   When run, it establishes a listener to be notified by the `Devtools Script` when the Devtools view is launched and needs to begin communicating with the tab (associated webpage).
    -   A single instance of this script is always running, and is responsible for pairing **all Devtools views** with **all associated webpages**.
-   The `Content Script` is launched alongside the webpage (specifically, it is injected into the webpage when the webpage is launched).
-   When run, it establishes a listener to be notified by the `Background Script` when it should begin relaying messages between the `Background Script` and the webpage (e.g. when the Devtools view is opened by the user).
-   A single instance of this script is injected into **each open tab**, and is responsible only for bridging communication between that tab and the singular `Background Script` service worker.
-   The `Devtools Script` is launched when the user opens our extension view in the browser's devtools panel.
-   When run, it establishes a connection with the `Background Script`, requesting that a connection be established such that information can flow from the `Content Script` injected into the tab (associated webpage) to the `Devtools Script` using the `Background Script` as a bridge.

What does this look like in terms of user flow?

   actor User
   participant Webpage
   participant Content Script
   participant Background Script
   participant Devtools Script

   activate Background Script

   User->>Webpage: User opens webpage.
   activate Content Script

   User->>Devtools Script: User opens the extension in the browser's devtools panel.
   activate Devtools Script

   Devtools Script->>Background Script: Devtools Script sends initialization request to Background Script.

   Background Script->>Content Script: Background Script initializes connection with Content Script.
   Content Script-->>Background Script: (Implicit acknowledgement, handled by browser APIs)
   Note over Background Script: Background Script begins listening for messages from Content Script and Devtools Script, and relays them between the two as appropriate.
   Note over Content Script: Content Script begins listening for messages from webpage and Background Script, and relays them between the two as appropriate.

   Background Script->>Devtools Script: Background Script sends connection acknowledgement to Devtools Script.
   Note over Devtools Script: Devtools Script begins listening for messages from Background Script, and begins posting messages to it.

   deactivate Background Script
   deactivate Content Script
   deactivate Devtools Script
```

## Working in the Package

### Building

To build the package, run `npm run build` in a terminal at the root directory of this package.

### Testing

#### Automated Testing

This package uses two different testing libraries for its unit vs end-to-end tests.
To run all of the automated tests, run `npm run test` in a terminal from the root directory of this package.

##### Unit Tests

This package uses [mocha](https://mochajs.org/) for its unit tests.
To run just the unit tests, run `npm run test:mocha` in a terminal from the root directory of this package.

##### End-To-End Tests

This package uses [jest](https://jestjs.io/) and a small backing test app to test end-to-end scenarios in a browser environment.
To run the automated end-to-end tests, run `npm run test:jest` in a terminal from the root directory of this package.

#### Local Extension Testing

To use a local build of this extension in your browser:

1. Build this package and its dependencies.
   Your extension files should be generated under the build output directory (`dist/bundle`) in this package directory.
2. Load the unpacked extension in the browser by following [these instructions](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted/development-basics/#load-unpacked).
    - For [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about) users, your Linux files should be at a \\wsl$ path.
      In File Explorer or any other Windows application that can browse files, navigate to the path: \\wsl$.
    - If you are working in a [Codespace](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/codespaces) with Visual Studio Code, you can download the build artifacts by right-clicking on `dist/bundle` in the `Explorer` view and clicking `download`. This will download the files to your local machine, which you can upload to the browser.
