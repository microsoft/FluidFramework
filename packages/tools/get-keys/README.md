This folder contains a script that will get secret values from the prague keyvault and store them as environment variables. In order to have access to the prague keyvault you must be a member of the prague-secrets or WAC Bohemia security group.

To run the script, run `npm i`, then `npm start`. The script will then prompt you to use a code to login to your Microsoft account. If you are using bash or zsh, you may have to restart the shell or run `source ~/.bashrc` or `source ~/.zshrc` after running the script.
