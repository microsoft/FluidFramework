# @fluid-internal/devtools-browser-extension

This package contains a browser (Chrome) developer tools extension for use with [@fluid-tools/client-debugger][].
It offers visual insights into the workings of the Fluid Framework in your application.

It is currently compatible with [Chromium](https://www.chromium.org/Home/)-based browsers (e.g. [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) and [Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge/)).

## Artifacts

This package does not generate any library artifacts, so it is marked as `private` in its `package.json`.

We are not yet publishing any artifacts to the Chrome/Edge extension stores, but that is planned for the near future.

## Usage

To use this extension in your browser:

1. Build this package and its dependencies.
   Your extension files should be generated under the build output directory (`dist/bundle`) in this package.
2. Load the unpacked extension in the browser by following [these instructions](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted/development-basics/#load-unpacked).
   For [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about) users, your Linux files should be at a \\wsl$ path.
   In File Explorer or any other Windows application that can browse files, navigate to the path: \\wsl$.

## Devtools Extensions

This package runs as a [Devtools Extension](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/devtools/) in Chromium-based browsers that support them.

For an overview on how Devtools extensions work, see [here](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/devtools/#content-script-to-devtools).
