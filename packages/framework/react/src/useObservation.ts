/**
 * Custom hook which invalidates a React Component based on changes to what was observed during `trackDuring`.
 *
 * @param trackDuring - Called synchronously: can make event subscriptions which call the provided `invalidate` function.
 * Any such subscriptions should be cleaned up via the returned `unsubscribe` function which will only be invoked if `invalidate` is not called.
 * If `invalidate` is called, the code calling it should remove any subscriptions before calling it.
 * @remarks
 * React strongly discourages "render" from having side-effects other than idempotent lazy initialization.
 *
 * Tracking observations made during render to subscribe to events for automatic invalidation is a side-effect.
 * This makes the behavior of this hook somewhat unusual from a React perspective, and also rather poorly supported by React.
 *
 * That said, the alternatives more aligned with how React expects things to work have much less friendly APIs, or have gaps where they risk invalidation bugs.
 *
 * For example, this hook could record which observations were made during render, then pass them into a `useEffect` hook to do the subscription.
 * This would be more aligned with React's expectations, but would have a number of issues:
 * - The effect would run after render, so if the observed content changed between render and the effect running, there could be an invalidation bug.
 * - It would require changes to `TreeAlpha.trackObservationsOnce` to support a two phase approach (first track, then subscribe) which would have the same risk of missed invalidation.
 * - It would have slightly higher cost due to the extra effect.
 * Such an approach is implemented in {@link useObservationPure}.

	// This is safe from a React perspective since when the observed content changes, that is reflected in the `useState` above.
	// What is more problematic is avoiding of leaking the event registrations since React does not provide an easy way to do that for code run outside of a hook.

	// This can almost be done using a React effect hook with an empty dependency list.
	// Unfortunately that would have a hard time getting the correct subscriptions to unsubscribe,
	// and if run before unmount, like in StrictMode, it would cause an invalidation bug.
	// Suppressing that invalidation bug with an extra call to setSubscriptions could work, but would produce incorrect warnings about leaks,
	// and might cause infinite rerender depending on how StrictMode works.
	// Such an Effect would look like this:
	// React.useEffect(
	// 	() => () => {
	// 		subscriptions.unsubscribe?.();
	// 		subscriptions.unsubscribe = undefined;
	// 		setSubscriptions({});
	// 	},
	// 	[],
	// );
	// Instead of that, use a FinalizationRegistry to clean up when the subscriptions.
	// As this only needs to run sometime after the component is unmounted, triggering it based on React no longer holding onto the subscriptions state object is sufficient.
	// This should be safe (not unsubscribe too early) as React will hold onto the state object for as long as the component is mounted since if the component rerenders, it will be required.
	// If React decided it would never reuse the component instance (recreate it instead of rerender) but kept it mounted, then it would be possible for this to unsubscribe too early.
	// Currently however, it does not seem like React does or will do that.
	// If such an issue does ever occur, it could be fixed by stuffing a reference to the `subscriptions` object in the DOM: for now such a mitigation appears unnecessary and would add overhead.
