 * This only handles a few cases (TreeNode, structurally typed objects fields and arrays) and leaves other types as is.
 * Users which provide other types (e.g. maps) which contain TreeNodes will need to handle wrapping those themselves if the wrapping is desired.
 *
 * Users of this should not rely on a given use of TreeNode not being wrapped:
 * future changes to this API may add more cases which are wrapped, and this will be considered a non-breaking change.
 * @privateRemarks
 * Covering all cases is impossible, and trying to cover more with recursive mapped types can break some of the types by losing methods, private members, etc.
 * To mitigate this IsMappableObjectType is used for objects, and only mappable types, where the mapping actually impacted the type are modified.
 *
 * This is intended to cover the common cases, and users can handle other cases manually.
 * See the tests for this for more details.
