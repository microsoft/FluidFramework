 * to the copied content, and combine it with its own copied content. These nested components should do the
 * same with their own nested components. What content a component provides is entirely up to it.
 *
 * Nested components might need to contribute multiple formats of clipboard data to their host components
 * (e.g. plain-text, HTML).
 *
 * In addition, a nested component should specify their complete fluid url in the **fluidUrlAttributeName**
 * data- attribute of its containing HTML element to ensure that the proper component is instantiated on paste.
