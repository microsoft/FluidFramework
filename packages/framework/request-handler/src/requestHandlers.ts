 * And last, but not least, it does not allow any policy to be implemented around GC of data stores exposed
 * through internal URIs. I.e. if there are no other references to such objects, they will be GC'd and
 * external links would get broken. Maybe that's what is needed in some cases, but better, more centralized
 * handling of external URI to internal handle is required (in future, we will support weak handle references,
