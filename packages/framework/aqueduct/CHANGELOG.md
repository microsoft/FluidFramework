# @fluidframework/aqueduct

## 2.0.0-rc.5.0.0

### Minor Changes

-   Update to TypeScript 5.4 ([#21214](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/pull/21214)) [0e6256c722](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/0e6256c722d8bf024f4325bf02547daeeb18bfa6)

    Update package implementations to use TypeScript 5.4.5.

## 2.0.0-rc.4.0.0

Dependency updates only.

## 2.0.0-rc.3.0.0

### Major Changes

-   Packages now use package.json "exports" and require modern module resolution [97d68aa06b](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/97d68aa06bd5c022ecb026655814aea222a062ae)

    Fluid Framework packages have been updated to use the [package.json "exports"
    field](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v18.x/api/packages.html#exports) to define explicit entry points for both
    TypeScript types and implementation code.

    This means that using Fluid Framework packages require the following TypeScript settings in tsconfig.json:

    -   `"moduleResolution": "Node16"` with `"module": "Node16"`
    -   `"moduleResolution": "Bundler"` with `"module": "ESNext"`

    We recommend using Node16/Node16 unless absolutely necessary. That will produce transpiled JavaScript that is suitable
    for use with modern versions of Node.js _and_ Bundlers.
    [See the TypeScript documentation](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#moduleResolution) for more information
    regarding the module and moduleResolution options.

    **Node10 moduleResolution is not supported; it does not support Fluid Framework's API structuring pattern that is used
    to distinguish stable APIs from those that are in development.**

## 2.0.0-rc.2.0.0

### Minor Changes

-   aqueduct: Deprecated PureDataObjectFactory.createRootInstance and replaced with PureDataObjectFactory.createInstanceWithDataStore ([#19471](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/issues/19471)) [0a79375ccb](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/0a79375ccb523658a2565b8796fa06ec45a69394)

    ### Deprecated: PureDataObjectFactory.createRootInstance

    This was deprecated because `PureDataObjectFactory.createRootInstance` has an issue at scale.
    `PureDataObjectFactory.createRootInstance` used the old method of creating `PureDataObject`s with names. The issue was
    that simultaneous creations could happen, and the old api had no good way of dealing with those types of collisions.
    This version slightly improved it by resolving those collisions by assuming whatever datastore was created with the
    alias or `rootDataStoreId` would just return that datastore. This will work for developers who expect the same type of
    `PureDataObject` to be returned from the `createRootInstance` api, but if a potentially different `PureDataObject`
    would be returned, then this api would give you the wrong typing.

    For a replacement api see `PureDataObjectFactory.createInstanceWithDataStore`.

    ### New method PureDataObjectFactory.createInstanceWithDataStore

    This was done as a replacement of `PureDataObjectFactory.createRootInstance`. This exposes the `IDataStore` interface
    in the form of `[PureDataObject, IDataStore]`. `IDataStore` provides the opportunity for developers to use the
    `IDataStore.trySetAlias` method. This can return 3 different scenarios `Success`, `Conflict`, or `AlreadyAliased`.
    These scenarios can allow the developer to handle conflicts as they wish.

-   aqueduct: PureDataObjectFactory.instantiateDataStore now returns IFluidDataStoreChannel ([#19353](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/issues/19353)) [3aad53da1e](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/3aad53da1ee8c4079d4f3b4a096361d23e0725ab)

    The return type of `PureDataObjectFactory.instantiateDataStore` was changed from `FluidDataStoreRuntime` to
    `IFluidDataStoreChannel`.

### Major Changes

-   aqueduct: ContainerRuntimeFactory constructors have changed [871b3493dd](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/871b3493dd0d7ea3a89be64998ceb6cb9021a04e)

    The following class constructors have been changed to allow for better flexible in arguments passed:

    -   `BaseContainerRuntimeFactory`
    -   `ContainerRuntimeFactoryWithDefaultDataStore`
    -   `RuntimeFactory`

    They now use a single object for constructor params. Example change to be made:

    ```ts
    // Old
    new BaseContainerRuntimeFactory(
    	myRegistryEntries,
    	myDependencyContainer,
    	myRequestHandlers,
    	myRuntimeOptions,
    	myProvideEntryPoint,
    );

    // New
    new BaseContainerRuntimeFactory({
    	registryEntries: myRegistryEntries,
    	dependencyContainer: myDependencyContainer,
    	requestHandlers: myRequestHandlers,
    	runtimeOptions: myRuntimeOptions,
    	provideEntryPoint: myProvideEntryPoint,
    });
    ```

-   DEPRECATED: container-runtime: requestHandlers are deprecated [871b3493dd](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/871b3493dd0d7ea3a89be64998ceb6cb9021a04e)

    The concept of `requestHandlers` has been deprecated. Please migrate all usage of the following APIs to the new `entryPoint` pattern:

    -   `requestHandler` property in `ContainerRuntime.loadRuntime(...)`
    -   `RuntimeRequestHandler`
    -   `RuntimeRequestHandlerBuilder`
    -   `defaultFluidObjectRequestHandler(...)`
    -   `defaultRouteRequestHandler(...)`
    -   `mountableViewRequestHandler(...)`
    -   `buildRuntimeRequestHandler(...)`
    -   `createFluidObjectResponse(...)`
    -   `handleFromLegacyUri(...)`
    -   `rootDataStoreRequestHandler(...)`

    See [Removing-IFluidRouter.md](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/blob/main/packages/common/core-interfaces/Removing-IFluidRouter.md) for more details.

-   DEPRECATED: container-loader: Various request related APIs have been deprecated [871b3493dd](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/871b3493dd0d7ea3a89be64998ceb6cb9021a04e)

    Please remove all calls to the following functions and instead use the new `entryPoint` pattern:

    -   `requestFluidObject`
    -   `requestResolvedObjectFromContainer`
    -   `getDefaultObjectFromContainer`
    -   `getObjectWithIdFromContainer`
    -   `getObjectFromContainer`

    See [Removing-IFluidRouter.md](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/blob/main/packages/common/core-interfaces/Removing-IFluidRouter.md) for more details.

-   container-definitions: IContainer's and IDataStore's IFluidRouter capabilities are deprecated [871b3493dd](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/871b3493dd0d7ea3a89be64998ceb6cb9021a04e)

    `IFluidRouter` and `request({ url: "/" })` on `IContainer` and `IDataStore` are deprecated and will be removed in a future major release. Please migrate all usage to the appropriate `getEntryPoint()` or `entryPoint` APIs.

    See [Removing-IFluidRouter.md](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/blob/main/packages/common/core-interfaces/Removing-IFluidRouter.md) for more details.

-   test-utils: provideEntryPoint is required [871b3493dd](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/871b3493dd0d7ea3a89be64998ceb6cb9021a04e)

    The optional `provideEntryPoint` method has become required on a number of constructors. A value will need to be provided to the following classes:

    -   `BaseContainerRuntimeFactory`
    -   `RuntimeFactory`
    -   `ContainerRuntime` (constructor and `loadRuntime`)
    -   `FluidDataStoreRuntime`

    See [testContainerRuntimeFactoryWithDefaultDataStore.ts](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/tree/main/packages/test/test-utils/src/testContainerRuntimeFactoryWithDefaultDataStore.ts) for an example implemtation of `provideEntryPoint` for ContainerRuntime.
    See [pureDataObjectFactory.ts](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/tree/main/packages/framework/aqueduct/src/data-object-factories/pureDataObjectFactory.ts#L83) for an example implementation of `provideEntryPoint` for DataStoreRuntime.

    Subsequently, various `entryPoint` and `getEntryPoint()` endpoints have become required. Please see [containerRuntime.ts](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/tree/main/packages/runtime/container-runtime/src/containerRuntime.ts) for example implementations of these APIs.

    For more details, see [Removing-IFluidRouter.md](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/blob/main/packages/common/core-interfaces/Removing-IFluidRouter.md)

-   Minimum TypeScript version now 5.1.6 [871b3493dd](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/871b3493dd0d7ea3a89be64998ceb6cb9021a04e)

    The minimum supported TypeScript version for Fluid 2.0 clients is now 5.1.6.

-   aqueduct: EventForwarder and IDisposable members removed from PureDataObject [871b3493dd](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/871b3493dd0d7ea3a89be64998ceb6cb9021a04e)

    The `EventForwarder` and `IDisposable` members of `PureDataObject` were deprecated in 2.0.0-internal.5.2.0 and have now been removed.

    If your code was overriding any methods/properties from `EventForwarder` and or `IDisposable` on a class that inherits
    (directly or transitively) from `PureDataObject`, you'll have to remove the `override` keyword.

## 2.0.0-internal.6.2.0

### Minor Changes

-   PureDataObject temporarily extends EventForwarder and implements IDisposable again ([#16846](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/issues/16846)) [9825a692dd](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/9825a692dd27eded214e3978a7fd6028b05e6fab)

    `PureDataObject` extends `EventForwarder` and implements `IDìsposable` again to ease the transition to `2.0.0-internal.6.x`.
    These interfaces will no longer be implemented on `PureDataObject` in version `2.0.0-internal.7.0.0`.

    The original deprecation announcement for these members can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/releases/tag/client_v2.0.0-internal.5.2.0).

    Once the change is re-applied in `2.0.0-internal.7.0.0`, if your code was overriding any methods/properties from
    `EventForwarder` and or `IDisposable` on a class that inherits (directly or transitively) from `PureDataObject`,
    you'll have to remove the `override` keyword.

-   Remove use of @fluidframework/common-definitions ([#16638](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/issues/16638)) [a8c81509c9](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/a8c81509c9bf09cfb2092ebcf7265205f9eb6dbf)

    The **@fluidframework/common-definitions** package is being deprecated, so the following interfaces and types are now
    imported from the **@fluidframework/core-interfaces** package:

    -   interface IDisposable
    -   interface IErrorEvent
    -   interface IErrorEvent
    -   interface IEvent
    -   interface IEventProvider
    -   interface ILoggingError
    -   interface ITaggedTelemetryPropertyType
    -   interface ITelemetryBaseEvent
    -   interface ITelemetryBaseLogger
    -   interface ITelemetryErrorEvent
    -   interface ITelemetryGenericEvent
    -   interface ITelemetryLogger
    -   interface ITelemetryPerformanceEvent
    -   interface ITelemetryProperties
    -   type ExtendEventProvider
    -   type IEventThisPlaceHolder
    -   type IEventTransformer
    -   type ReplaceIEventThisPlaceHolder
    -   type ReplaceIEventThisPlaceHolder
    -   type TelemetryEventCategory
    -   type TelemetryEventPropertyType

### Major Changes

-   `initializeEntryPoint` will become required [8abce8cdb4](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/8abce8cdb4e2832fb6405fb44e393bef03d5648a)

    The optional `initializeEntryPoint` method has been added to a number of constructors. **This method argument will become required in an upcoming release** and a value will need to be provided to the following classes:

    -   `BaseContainerRuntimeFactory`
    -   `ContainerRuntimeFactoryWithDefaultDataStore`
    -   `RuntimeFactory`
    -   `ContainerRuntime` (constructor and `loadRuntime`)
    -   `FluidDataStoreRuntime`

    For an example implementation of `initializeEntryPoint`, see [pureDataObjectFactory.ts](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/blob/main/packages/framework/aqueduct/src/data-object-factories/pureDataObjectFactory.ts#L84).

    This work will replace the request pattern. See [Removing-IFluidRouter.md](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/blob/main/packages/common/core-interfaces/Removing-IFluidRouter.md) for more info on this effort.

-   EventForwarder and IDisposable members removed from PureDataObject [8abce8cdb4](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/8abce8cdb4e2832fb6405fb44e393bef03d5648a)

    The EventForwarder and IDisposable members of PureDataObject were deprecated in 2.0.0-internal.5.2.0 and have now been removed.

-   Upgraded typescript transpilation target to ES2020 [8abce8cdb4](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/8abce8cdb4e2832fb6405fb44e393bef03d5648a)

    Upgraded typescript transpilation target to ES2020. This is done in order to decrease the bundle sizes of Fluid Framework packages. This has provided size improvements across the board for ex. Loader, Driver, Runtime etc. Reduced bundle sizes helps to load lesser code in apps and hence also helps to improve the perf.If any app wants to target any older versions of browsers with which this target version is not compatible, then they can use packages like babel to transpile to a older target.

### Minor Changes

-   EventForwarder and IDisposable members deprecated from PureDataObject ([#16201](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/issues/16201)) [0e838fdb3e](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/0e838fdb3e8187481f41c4116a67458c2a1658d5)

    The EventForwarder and IDisposable members have been deprecated from PureDataObject and will be removed in an upcoming release. The EventForwarder pattern was mostly unused by the current implementation, and is also recommended against generally (instead, register and forward events explicitly). The disposal implementation was incomplete and likely to cause poor behavior as the disposal was not observable by default. Inheritors of the PureDataObject can of course still implement their own disposal logic.

    -   `PureDataObject.getFluidObjectFromDirectory`
    -   `IProvideContainerRuntime` and its `IContainerRuntime` member.
    -   `ContainerRuntime`'s `IProvideContainerRuntime` has also been removed.

## 2.0.0-internal.4.4.0

### Minor Changes

-   `PureDataObject.getFluidObjectFromDirectory` has been deprecated and will be removed in an upcoming release. Instead prefer to interface directly with the directory and handles. [9238304c77](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/9238304c772d447225f6f86417033ca8004c0edd)
