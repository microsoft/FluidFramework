/**
 * The `aqueduct` package is a library for building Fluid objects and Fluid
 * containers within the Fluid Framework. Its goal is to provide a thin base
 * layer over the existing Fluid Framework interfaces that allows developers to
 * get started quickly.
 *
 * @remarks
 * About the library name: An "aqueduct" is a way to transport water from a source
 * to another location. The library name was chosen because its purpose is to
 * facilitate using lower level constructs and therefore handle 'fluid' items
 * same as an aqueduct.
