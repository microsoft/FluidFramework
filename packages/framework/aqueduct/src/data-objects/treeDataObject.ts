 * @remarks
 *
 * In order to view the tree's data, consumers of this type will need to apply the appropriate view schema to the {@link TreeDataObject.tree}.
 * This will generally be done via {@link PureDataObject.initializingFromExisting} and {@link PureDataObject.initializingFirstTime} methods.
 *
 * To initialize the tree's data for initial creation, implementers of this class will need to override {@link PureDataObject.initializingFirstTime} and set the data in the schema-aware view.
 *
 * @typeParam TDataObjectTypes - The optional input types used to strongly type the data object.
 *
 * @example Implementing `initializingFirstTime`
 *
 * ```typescript
 * protected override async initializingFirstTime(): Promise<void> {
 * 	// Generate the schema-aware view of the tree.
 * 	this.treeView = this.tree.viewWith(treeViewConfiguration);
 *
 * 	// Initialize the tree with initial data.
 * 	this.treeView.initialize(initialTree);
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * @example Implementing `initializingFromExisting`
 *
 * ```typescript
 * protected override async initializingFromExisting(): Promise<void> {
 * 	// Generate the schema-aware view of the tree.
 * 	this.treeView = this.tree.viewWith(treeViewConfiguration);
 *
 *  // Ensure the loaded tree is compatible with the view schema.
 * 	if (!this.treeView.compatibility.canView) {
 * 		// Handle out-of-schema data as appropriate.
 * 	}
