### Major Changes

-   sequence: Add experimental support for the obliterate operation [9a451d4946](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/9a451d4946b5c51a52e4d1ab5bf51e7b285b0d74)

    This change adds experimental support for _obliterate_, a form of _remove_ that deletes concurrently inserted segments.
    To use, enable the `mergeTreeEnableObliterate` feature flag and call the new `obliterateRange` functions.

    Note: this change may cause compilation errors for those attaching event listeners. As long as obliterate isn't used in
    current handlers, their current implementation is sound.

### Major Changes

-   Upgraded typescript transpilation target to ES2020 [8abce8cdb4](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/8abce8cdb4e2832fb6405fb44e393bef03d5648a)

    Upgraded typescript transpilation target to ES2020. This is done in order to decrease the bundle sizes of Fluid Framework packages. This has provided size improvements across the board for ex. Loader, Driver, Runtime etc. Reduced bundle sizes helps to load lesser code in apps and hence also helps to improve the perf.If any app wants to target any older versions of browsers with which this target version is not compatible, then they can use packages like babel to transpile to a older target.
