### Minor Changes

-   SharedString DDS annotateAdjustRange ([#22751](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/pull/22751)) [d54b9dde14](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/d54b9dde14e9e0e5eb7999db8ebf6da98fdfb526)

    This update introduces a new feature to the `SharedString` DDS, allowing for the adjustment of properties over a specified range. The `annotateAdjustRange` method enables users to apply adjustments to properties within a given range, providing more flexibility and control over property modifications.

    An adjustment is a modification applied to a property value within a specified range. Adjustments can be used to increment or decrement property values dynamically. They are particularly useful in scenarios where property values need to be updated based on user interactions or other events. For example, in a rich text editor, adjustments can be used for modifying indentation levels or font sizes, where multiple users could apply differing numerical adjustments.

    ### Key Features and Use Cases:

    -   **Adjustments with Constraints**: Adjustments can include optional minimum and maximum constraints to ensure the final value falls within specified bounds. This is particularly useful for maintaining consistent formatting in rich text editors.
    -   **Consistent Property Changes**: The feature ensures that property changes are consistent, managing both local and remote changes effectively. This is essential for collaborative rich text editing where multiple users may be making adjustments simultaneously.
    -   **Rich Text Formatting**: Adjustments can be used to modify text properties such as font size, indentation, or other formatting attributes dynamically based on user actions.

    ### Configuration and Compatibility Requirements:

    This feature is only available when the configuration `Fluid.Sequence.mergeTreeEnableAnnotateAdjust` is set to `true`. Additionally, all collaborating clients must have this feature enabled to use it. If any client does not have this feature enabled, it will lead to the client exiting collaboration. A future major version of Fluid will enable this feature by default.

    ### Usage Example:

    ```typescript
    sharedString.annotateAdjustRange(start, end, {
    	key: { value: 5, min: 0, max: 10 },
    });
    ```

### Minor Changes

-   Update to TypeScript 5.4 ([#21214](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/pull/21214)) [0e6256c722](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/0e6256c722d8bf024f4325bf02547daeeb18bfa6)

### Major Changes

-   Packages now use package.json "exports" and require modern module resolution [97d68aa06b](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/97d68aa06bd5c022ecb026655814aea222a062ae)

    Fluid Framework packages have been updated to use the [package.json "exports"
    field](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v18.x/api/packages.html#exports) to define explicit entry points for both
    TypeScript types and implementation code.

    This means that using Fluid Framework packages require the following TypeScript settings in tsconfig.json:

    -   `"moduleResolution": "Node16"` with `"module": "Node16"`
    -   `"moduleResolution": "Bundler"` with `"module": "ESNext"`

    We recommend using Node16/Node16 unless absolutely necessary. That will produce transpiled JavaScript that is suitable
    for use with modern versions of Node.js _and_ Bundlers.
    [See the TypeScript documentation](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#moduleResolution) for more information
    regarding the module and moduleResolution options.

    **Node10 moduleResolution is not supported; it does not support Fluid Framework's API structuring pattern that is used
    to distinguish stable APIs from those that are in development.**

### Major Changes

-   sequence: Add experimental support for the obliterate operation [9a451d4946](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/9a451d4946b5c51a52e4d1ab5bf51e7b285b0d74)

    This change adds experimental support for _obliterate_, a form of _remove_ that deletes concurrently inserted segments.
    To use, enable the `mergeTreeEnableObliterate` feature flag and call the new `obliterateRange` functions.

    Note: this change may cause compilation errors for those attaching event listeners. As long as obliterate isn't used in
    current handlers, their current implementation is sound.

### Major Changes

-   Upgraded typescript transpilation target to ES2020 [8abce8cdb4](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/8abce8cdb4e2832fb6405fb44e393bef03d5648a)

    Upgraded typescript transpilation target to ES2020. This is done in order to decrease the bundle sizes of Fluid Framework packages. This has provided size improvements across the board for ex. Loader, Driver, Runtime etc. Reduced bundle sizes helps to load lesser code in apps and hence also helps to improve the perf.If any app wants to target any older versions of browsers with which this target version is not compatible, then they can use packages like babel to transpile to a older target.
