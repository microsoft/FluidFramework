 * notified of) components that implement IFluidHTMLView. Then, using these patterns,
 * it will be notified of all loaded components that implement that type on load, and
 * of all new components that are loaded during that session that implement IFluidHTMLView.
 *
 * Components who want their functionality to be discoverable should implement
 * IComponentDiscoverableInterfaces and list the interfaces they implement. Components that
 * want to be notified of other components that implement certain interfaces should implement
 * IComponentDiscoverInterfaces.
 *
 * This file also includes the interface for an IComponentInterfacesRegistry, which we use
 * to implement a component that carries out the matching between different components.
 *
 * Disclaimer: These interfaces are experimental and are subject to change.
