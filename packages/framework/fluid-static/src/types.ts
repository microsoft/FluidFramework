 * There are some edge cases in TypeScript where the order of the members in a union matter.
 * Once such edge case is when multiple members of a generic union partially match, and the type parameter is being inferred.
 * In this case, its better to have the desired match and/or the simpler type first.
 * In this case placing ISharedObjectKind fixed one usage and didn't break anything, and generally seems more likely to work than the reverse, so this is the order being used.
 * This is likely (a bug in TypeScript)[https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/45809].
