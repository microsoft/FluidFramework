 * #### Listener signature

 *
 * #### Listener signature
 *
 * ```typescript
 * () => void;

 *
 * The saved event is emitted when the `IFluidContainer` has local changes acknowledged by the service.
 *
 * #### Listener signature
 *
 * ```typescript
 * () => void

 * ### "dirty"
 *
 * The dirty event is emitted when the `IFluidContainer` has local changes that have not yet
 * been acknowledged by the service.
