## Using Fluid Framework libraries

When taking a dependency on a Fluid Framework library, we recommend using a `^` (caret) version range, such as `^1.3.4`.
While Fluid Framework libraries may use different ranges with interdependencies between other Fluid Framework libraries,
library consumers should always prefer `^`.

Note that when depending on a library version of the form `2.0.0-internal.x.y.z`, called the Fluid internal version scheme,
you must use a `>= <` dependency range (such as `>=2.0.0-internal.x.y.z <2.0.0-internal.w.0.0` where `w` is `x+1`).
Standard `^` and `~` ranges will not work as expected.
See the [@fluid-tools/version-tools](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/blob/main/build-tools/packages/version-tools/README.md)
package for more information including tools to convert between version schemes.

## Using fluid-static

The `fluid-static` package contains a container with a pre-created default data object with the ability to create and store additional objects. This is abstracted behind a developer-friendly `FluidContainer` interface that provides configurations for defining the container's initial object and supported dynamic object types, as well as callbacks for creating and fetching DDSes and data objects.

This is consumed by separate client packages, such as [TinyliciousClient](../tinylicious-client/README.MD) for the Tinylicious service, to provide an easy way of creating and fetching FluidContainer instances that are backed by data stored on the respective services.
