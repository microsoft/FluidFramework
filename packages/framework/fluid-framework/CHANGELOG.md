# fluid-framework

## 2.10.0

### Minor Changes

-   Unsupported merge-tree types and related exposed internals have been removed ([#22696](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/pull/22696)) [7a032533a6](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/7a032533a6ee6a6f76fe154ef65dfa33f87e5a7b)

    As part of ongoing improvements, several internal types and related APIs have been removed. These types are unnecessary for any supported scenarios and could lead to errors if used. Since directly using these types would likely result in errors, these changes are not likely to impact any Fluid Framework consumers.

    Removed types:

    -   IMergeTreeTextHelper
    -   MergeNode
    -   ObliterateInfo
    -   PropertiesManager
    -   PropertiesRollback
    -   SegmentGroup
    -   SegmentGroupCollection

    In addition to removing the above types, they are no longer exposed through the following interfaces and their implementations: `ISegment`, `ReferencePosition`, and `ISerializableInterval`.

    Removed functions:

    -   addProperties
    -   ack

    Removed properties:

    -   propertyManager
    -   segmentGroups

    The initial deprecations of the now changed or removed types were announced in Fluid Framework v2.2.0:
    [Fluid Framework v2.2.0](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/blob/main/RELEASE_NOTES/2.2.0.md)

-   Fix typing bug in `adaptEnum` and `enumFromStrings` ([#23077](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/pull/23077)) [cfb68388cb](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/cfb68388cb6b88a0ef670633b3afa46a82c99972)

    When using the return value from [`adaptEnum`](https://fluidframework.com/docs/api/v2/tree#adaptenum-function) as a function, passing in a value who's type is a union no longer produced an incorrectly typed return value. This has been fixed.

    Additionally [`enumFromStrings`](https://fluidframework.com/docs/api/v2/tree#enumfromstrings-function) has improved the typing of its schema, ensuring the returned object's members have sufficiently specific types.
    Part of this improvement was fixing the `.schema` property to be a tuple over each of the schema where it was previously a tuple of a single combined schema due to a bug.

    One side-effect of these fixes is that narrowing of the `value` field of a node typed from the `.schema` behaves slightly different, such that the node type is now a union instead of it being a single type with a `.value` that is a union.
    This means that narrowing based on `.value` property narrows which node type you have, not just the value property.
    This mainly matters when matching all cases like the switch statement below:

    ```typescript
    const Mode = enumFromStrings(schema, ["Fun", "Bonus"]);
    type Mode = TreeNodeFromImplicitAllowedTypes<typeof Mode.schema>;
    const node = new Mode.Bonus() as Mode;

    switch (node.value) {
    	case "Fun": {
    		assert.fail();
    	}
    	case "Bonus": {
    		// This one runs
    		break;
    	}
    	default:
    		// Before this change, "node.value" was never here, now "node" is never.
    		unreachableCase(node);
    }
    ```

-   SharedTree event listeners that implement `Listenable` now allow deregistration of event listeners via an `off()` function. ([#23046](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/pull/23046)) [c59225db03](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/c59225db033a516ee20e459ae31567d97ce8776c)

    The ability to deregister events via a callback returned by `on()` remains the same.
    Both strategies will remain supported and consumers of SharedTree events may choose which method of deregistration they prefer in a given instance.

    ```typescript
    // The new behavior
    function deregisterViaOff(view: TreeView<MySchema>): {
    	const listener = () => { /* ... */ };
    	view.events.on("commitApplied", listener); // Register
    	view.events.off("commitApplied", listener); // Deregister
    }

    // The existing behavior (still supported)
    function deregisterViaCallback(view: TreeView<MySchema>): {
    	const off = view.events.on("commitApplied", () => { /* ... */ }); // Register
    	off(); // Deregister
    }
    ```

-   Allow constructing recursive maps from objects ([#23070](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/pull/23070)) [0185a08c6f](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/0185a08c6f8bf6e922a6467f11da049503c4d215)

    Previously only non-recursive maps could be constructed from objects.
    Now all maps nodes can constructed from objects:

    ```typescript
    class MapRecursive extends sf.mapRecursive("Map", [() => MapRecursive]) {}
    {
    	type _check = ValidateRecursiveSchema<typeof MapRecursive>;
    }
    // New:
    const fromObject = new MapRecursive({ x: new MapRecursive() });
    // Existing:
    const fromIterator = new MapRecursive([["x", new MapRecursive()]]);
    const fromMap = new MapRecursive(new Map([["x", new MapRecursive()]]));
    const fromNothing = new MapRecursive();
    const fromUndefined = new MapRecursive(undefined);
    ```

-   SharedString DDS annotateAdjustRange ([#22751](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/pull/22751)) [d54b9dde14](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/d54b9dde14e9e0e5eb7999db8ebf6da98fdfb526)

    This update introduces a new feature to the `SharedString` DDS, allowing for the adjustment of properties over a specified range. The `annotateAdjustRange` method enables users to apply adjustments to properties within a given range, providing more flexibility and control over property modifications.

    An adjustment is a modification applied to a property value within a specified range. Adjustments can be used to increment or decrement property values dynamically. They are particularly useful in scenarios where property values need to be updated based on user interactions or other events. For example, in a rich text editor, adjustments can be used for modifying indentation levels or font sizes, where multiple users could apply differing numerical adjustments.

    ### Key Features and Use Cases:

    -   **Adjustments with Constraints**: Adjustments can include optional minimum and maximum constraints to ensure the final value falls within specified bounds. This is particularly useful for maintaining consistent formatting in rich text editors.
    -   **Consistent Property Changes**: The feature ensures that property changes are consistent, managing both local and remote changes effectively. This is essential for collaborative rich text editing where multiple users may be making adjustments simultaneously.
    -   **Rich Text Formatting**: Adjustments can be used to modify text properties such as font size, indentation, or other formatting attributes dynamically based on user actions.

    ### Configuration and Compatibility Requirements:

    This feature is only available when the configuration `Fluid.Sequence.mergeTreeEnableAnnotateAdjust` is set to `true`. Additionally, all collaborating clients must have this feature enabled to use it. If any client does not have this feature enabled, it will lead to the client exiting collaboration. A future major version of Fluid will enable this feature by default.

    ### Usage Example:

    ```typescript
    sharedString.annotateAdjustRange(start, end, {
    	key: { value: 5, min: 0, max: 10 },
    });
    ```

-   MergeTree `Client` Legacy API Removed ([#22697](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/pull/22697)) [2aa0b5e794](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/2aa0b5e7941efe52386782595f96ff847c786fc3)

    The `Client` class in the merge-tree package has been removed. Types that directly or indirectly expose the merge-tree `Client` class have also been removed.

    The removed types were not meant to be used directly, and direct usage was not supported:

    -   AttributionPolicy
    -   IClientEvents
    -   IMergeTreeAttributionOptions
    -   SharedSegmentSequence
    -   SharedStringClass

    Some classes that referenced the `Client` class have been transitioned to interfaces. Direct instantiation of these classes was not supported or necessary for any supported scenario, so the change to an interface should not impact usage. This applies to the following types:

    -   SequenceInterval
    -   SequenceEvent
    -   SequenceDeltaEvent
    -   SequenceMaintenanceEvent

    The initial deprecations of the now changed or removed types were announced in Fluid Framework v2.4.0:
    [Several MergeTree Client Legacy APIs are now deprecated](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/blob/main/RELEASE_NOTES/2.4.0.md#several-mergetree-client-legacy-apis-are-now-deprecated-22629)

## 2.5.0

### Minor Changes

-   âœ¨ New! Alpha APIs for tree data import and export ([#22566](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/pull/22566)) [18a23e8816](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/18a23e8816467f2ed0c9d6d8637b70d99aa48b7a)

    A collection of new `@alpha` APIs for importing and exporting tree content and schema from SharedTrees has been added to `TreeAlpha`.
    These include import and export APIs for `VerboseTree`, `ConciseTree` and compressed tree formats.

    `TreeAlpha.create` is also added to allow constructing trees with a more general API instead of having to use the schema constructor directly (since that doesn't handle polymorphic roots, or non-schema aware code).

    The function `independentInitializedView` has been added to provide a way to combine data from the existing `extractPersistedSchema` and new `TreeAlpha.exportCompressed` back into a `TreeView` in a way which can support safely importing data which could have been exported with a different schema.
    This allows replicating the schema evolution process for Fluid documents stored in a service, but entirely locally without involving any collaboration services.
    `independentView` has also been added, which is similar but handles the case of creating a new view without an existing schema or tree.

    Together these APIs address several use-cases:

    1. Using SharedTree as an in-memory non-collaborative datastore.
    2. Importing and exporting data from a SharedTree to and from other services or storage locations (such as locally saved files).
    3. Testing various scenarios without relying on a service.
    4. Using SharedTree libraries for just the schema system and encode/decode support.

-   Compilation no longer fails when building with TypeScript's libCheck option ([#22923](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/pull/22923)) [a1b4cdd45e](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/a1b4cdd45ee9812e2598ab8d2854333d26a06eb4)

    When compiling code using Fluid Framework with TypeScript's `libCheck` (meaning without [skipLibCheck](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig/#skipLibCheck)), two compile errors can be encountered:

    ```
    > tsc

    node_modules/@fluidframework/merge-tree/lib/client.d.ts:124:18 - error TS2368: Type parameter name cannot be 'undefined'.

    124     walkSegments<undefined>(handler: ISegmentAction<undefined>, start?: number, end?: number, accum?: undefined, splitRange?: boolean): void;
                         ~~~~~~~~~

    node_modules/@fluidframework/tree/lib/util/utils.d.ts:5:29 - error TS7016: Could not find a declaration file for module '@ungap/structured-clone'. 'node_modules/@ungap/structured-clone/esm/index.js' implicitly has an 'any' type.
      Try `npm i --save-dev @types/ungap__structured-clone` if it exists or add a new declaration (.d.ts) file containing `declare module '@ungap/structured-clone';`

    5 import structuredClone from "@ungap/structured-clone";
                                  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    ```

    The first error impacts projects using TypeScript 5.5 or greater and either of the `fluid-framework` or `@fluidframework/merge-tree` packages.
    The second error impacts projects using the `noImplicitAny` tsconfig setting and the `fluid-framework` or `@fluidframework/tree` packages.

    Both errors have been fixed.

    This should allow `libCheck` to be reenabled in any impacted projects.

-   A `.schema` member has been added to the alpha enum schema APIs ([#22874](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/pull/22874)) [645b9ed695](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/645b9ed69540338843ad14f1144ff4d1f80d6f09)

    The return value from `@alpha` APIs `enumFromStrings` and `adaptEnum` now has a property named `schema` which can be used to include it in a parent schema.
    This replaces the use of `typedObjectValues` which has been removed.

    Use of these APIs now look like:

    ```typescript
    const schemaFactory = new SchemaFactory("com.myApp");
    const Mode = enumFromStrings(schemaFactory, ["Fun", "Cool"]);
    type Mode = NodeFromSchema<(typeof Mode.schema)[number]>;
    class Parent extends schemaFactory.object("Parent", { mode: Mode.schema }) {}
    ```

    Previously, the last two lines would have been:

    ```typescript
    type Mode = NodeFromSchema<(typeof Mode)[keyof typeof Mode]>; // This no longer works
    class Parent extends schemaFactory.object("Parent", { mode: typedObjectValues(Mode) }) {} // This no longer works
    ```

-   TreeNodeSchemaClass now specifies its TNode as TreeNode ([#22938](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/pull/22938)) [b669a6efdb](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/b669a6efdba685c71897cade4f907304f1a73910)

    `TreeNodeSchemaClass`'s `TNode` parameter was formerly `unknown` and has been improved to be the more specific `TreeNode | TreeLeafValue`.
    This change further narrows this to `TreeNode`.

    `TreeNodeSchema`, which is more commonly used, still permits `TNode` of `TreeNode | TreeLeafValue`, so this change should have little impact on most code, but in some edge cases it can result in slightly more specific typing.

-   Array and Map nodes can now be explicitly constructed with undefined or no argument ([#22946](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/pull/22946)) [176335ce88](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/176335ce88d005159819c559b445a1655ec429d5)

    The input parameter to the constructor and `create` methods of Array and Map nodes is now optional. When the optional parameter is omitted, an empty map or array will be created.

    #### Examples

    ```typescript
    class Schema extends schemaFactory.array("x", schemaFactory.number) {}

    // Existing support
    const _fromIterable: Schema = new Schema([]);

    // New
    const _fromUndefined: Schema = new Schema(undefined);
    const _fromNothing: Schema = new Schema();
    ```

    ```typescript
    class Schema extends schemaFactory.map("x", schemaFactory.number) {}

    // Existing support
    const _fromIterable: Schema = new Schema([]);
    const _fromObject: Schema = new Schema({});

    // New
    const _fromUndefined: Schema = new Schema(undefined);
    const _fromNothing: Schema = new Schema();
    ```

    ```typescript
    const Schema = schemaFactory.array(schemaFactory.number);
    type Schema = NodeFromSchema<typeof Schema>;

    // Existing support
    const _fromIterable: Schema = Schema.create([]);

    // New
    const _fromUndefined: Schema = Schema.create(undefined);
    const _fromNothing: Schema = Schema.create();
    ```

    ```typescript
    const Schema = schemaFactory.map(schemaFactory.number);
    type Schema = NodeFromSchema<typeof Schema>;
    // Existing support
    const _fromIterable: Schema = Schema.create([]);
    const _fromObject: Schema = Schema.create({});

    // New
    const _fromUndefined: Schema = Schema.create(undefined);
    const _fromNothing: Schema = Schema.create();
    ```

-   Typing has been improved when an exact TypeScript type for a schema is not provided ([#22763](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/pull/22763)) [05197d6d3f](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/05197d6d3f0189ecd61fd74ec55f6836e6797249)

    The Tree APIs are designed to be used in a strongly typed way, with the full TypeScript type for the schema always being provided.
    Due to limitations of the TypeScript language, there was no practical way to prevent less descriptive types, like `TreeNodeSchema` or `ImplicitFieldSchema`, from being used where the type of a specific schema was intended.
    Code which does this will encounter several issues with tree APIs, and this change fixes some of those issues.
    This change mainly fixes that `NodeFromSchema<TreeNodeSchema>` used to return `unknown` and now returns `TreeNode | TreeLeafValue`.

    This change by itself seems mostly harmless, as it just improves the precision of the typing in this one edge case.
    Unfortunately, there are other typing bugs which complicate the situation, causing APIs for inserting data into the tree to also behave poorly when given non-specific types like `TreeNodeSchema`.
    These APIs include cases like `TreeView.initialize`.

    This incorrectly allowed some usage like taking a type-erased schema and initial tree pair, creating a view of type `TreeView<ImplicitFieldSchema>`, then initializing it.
    With the typing being partly fixed, some unsafe inputs are still allowed when trying to initialize such a view, but some are now prevented.

    This use-case of modifying trees in code not that is not strongly typed by the exact schema was not intended to be supported.
    Despite this, it did mostly work in some cases, and has some real use-cases (like tests looping over test data consisting of pairs of schema and initial trees).
    To help mitigate the impact of this change, some experimental `@alpha` APIs have been introduced to help address these previously unsupported but somewhat working use-cases.

    Before this change:

    ```typescript
    import { TinyliciousClient } from "@fluidframework/tinylicious-client";
    import {
    	SchemaFactory,
    	SharedTree,
    	TreeViewConfiguration,
    	type TreeNodeSchema,
    } from "fluid-framework";

    // Create a ITree instance
    const tinyliciousClient = new TinyliciousClient();
    const { container } = await tinyliciousClient.createContainer({ initialObjects: {} }, "2");
    const tree = await container.create(SharedTree);

    const schemaFactory = new SchemaFactory("demo");

    // Bad: This loses the schema aware type information. `: TreeNodeSchema` should be omitted to preserve strong typing.
    const schema: TreeNodeSchema = schemaFactory.array(schemaFactory.number);
    const config = new TreeViewConfiguration({ schema });

    // This view is typed as `TreeView<TreeNodeSchema>`, which does not work well since it's missing the actual schema type information.
    const view = tree.viewWith(config);
    // Root is typed as `unknown` allowing invalid assignment operations.
    view.root = "invalid";
    view.root = {};
    // Since all assignments are allowed, valid ones still work:
    view.root = [];
    ```

    After this change:

    ```typescript
    // Root is now typed as `TreeNode | TreeLeafValue`, still allowing some invalid assignment operations.
    // In the future this should be prevented as well, since the type of the setter in this case should be `never`.
    view.root = "invalid";
    // This no longer compiles:
    view.root = {};
    // This also no longer compiles despite being valid at runtime:
    view.root = [];
    ```

    For code that wants to continue using an unsafe API, which can result in runtime errors if the data does not follow the schema, a new alternative has been added to address this use-case. A special type `UnsafeUnknownSchema` can now be used to opt into allowing all valid trees to be provided.
    Note that this leaves ensuring the data is in schema up to the user.
    For now these adjusted APIs can be accessed by casting the view to `TreeViewAlpha<UnsafeUnknownSchema>`.
    If stabilized, this option will be added to `TreeView` directly.

    ```typescript
    const viewAlpha = view as TreeViewAlpha<UnsafeUnknownSchema>;
    viewAlpha.initialize([]);
    viewAlpha.root = [];
    ```

    Additionally, this seems to have negatively impacted co-recursive schema which declare a co-recursive array as the first schema in the co-recursive cycle.
    Like the TypeScript language our schema system is built on, we don't guarantee exactly which recursive type will compile, but will do our best to ensure useful recursive schema can be created easily.
    In this case a slight change may be required to some recursive schema to get them to compile again:

    For example this schema used to compile:

    ```typescript
    class A extends sf.arrayRecursive("A", [() => B]) {}
    {
    	type _check = ValidateRecursiveSchema<typeof A>;
    }
    // Used to work, but breaks in this update.
    class B extends sf.object("B", { x: A }) {}
    ```

    But now you must use the recursive functions like `objectRecursive` for types which are co-recursive with an array in some cases.
    In our example, it can be fixed as follows:

    ```typescript
    class A extends sf.arrayRecursive("A", [() => B]) {}
    {
    	type _check = ValidateRecursiveSchema<typeof A>;
    }
    // Fixed corecursive type, using "Recursive" method variant to declare schema.
    class B extends sf.objectRecursive("B", { x: A }) {}
    {
    	type _check = ValidateRecursiveSchema<typeof B>;
    }
    ```

    Note: while the following pattern may still compile, we recommend using the previous pattern instead since the one below may break in the future.

    ```typescript
    class B extends sf.objectRecursive("B", { x: [() => A] }) {}
    {
    	type _check = ValidateRecursiveSchema<typeof B>;
    }
    // Works, for now, but not recommended.
    class A extends sf.array("A", B) {}
    ```

-   The strictness of input tree types when inexact schemas are provided has been improved ([#22874](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/pull/22874)) [645b9ed695](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/645b9ed69540338843ad14f1144ff4d1f80d6f09)

    Consider the following code where the type of the schema is not exactly specified:

    ```typescript
    const schemaFactory = new SchemaFactory("com.myApp");
    class A extends schemaFactory.object("A", {}) {}
    class B extends schemaFactory.array("B", schemaFactory.number) {}

    // Gives imprecise type (typeof A | typeof B)[]. The desired precise type here is [typeof A, typeof B].
    const schema = [A, B];

    const config = new TreeViewConfiguration({ schema });
    const view = sharedTree.viewWith(config);

    // Does not compile since setter for root is typed `never` due to imprecise schema.
    view.root = [];
    ```

    The assignment of `view.root` is disallowed since a schema with type `(typeof A | typeof B)[]` could be any of:

    ```typescript
    const schema: (typeof A | typeof B)[] = [A];
    ```

    ```typescript
    const schema: (typeof A | typeof B)[] = [B];
    ```

    ```typescript
    const schema: (typeof A | typeof B)[] = [A, B];
    ```

    The attempted assignment is not compatible with all of these (specifically it is incompatible with the first one) so performing this assignment could make the tree out of schema and is thus disallowed.

    To avoid this ambiguity and capture the precise type of `[typeof A, typeof B]`, use one of the following patterns:

    ```typescript
    const schema = [A, B] as const;
    const config = new TreeViewConfiguration({ schema });
    ```

    ```typescript
    const config = new TreeViewConfiguration({ schema: [A, B] });
    ```

    To help update existing code which accidentally depended on this bug, an `@alpha` API `unsafeArrayToTuple` has been added.
    Many usages of this API will produce incorrectly typed outputs.
    However, when given `AllowedTypes` arrays which should not contain any unions, but that were accidentally flattened to a single union, it can fix them:

    ```typescript
    // Gives imprecise type (typeof A | typeof B)[]
    const schemaBad = [A, B];
    // Fixes the type to be [typeof A, typeof B]
    const schema = unsafeArrayToTuple(schemaBad);

    const config = new TreeViewConfiguration({ schema });
    ```

## 2.4.0

### Minor Changes

-   âœ¨ New! Alpha API for providing SharedTree configuration options ([#22701](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/pull/22701)) [40d3648ddf](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/40d3648ddfb5223ef6daef49a4f5cab1cfa52b71)

    A new alpha `configuredSharedTree` had been added.
    This allows providing configuration options, primarily for debugging, testing and evaluation of upcoming features.
    The resulting configured `SharedTree` object can then be used in-place of the regular `SharedTree` imported from `fluid-framework`.

    ```typescript
    import {
    	ForestType,
    	TreeCompressionStrategy,
    	configuredSharedTree,
    	typeboxValidator,
    } from "@fluid-framework/alpha";
    // Maximum debuggability and validation enabled:
    const SharedTree = configuredSharedTree({
    	forest: ForestType.Expensive,
    	jsonValidator: typeboxValidator,
    	treeEncodeType: TreeCompressionStrategy.Uncompressed,
    });
    // Opts into the under development optimized tree storage planned to be the eventual default implementation:
    const SharedTree = configuredSharedTree({
    	forest: ForestType.Optimized,
    });
    ```

-   âœ¨ New! Alpha API for snapshotting Schema ([#22733](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/pull/22733)) [920a65f66e](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/920a65f66e0caad7e1b5e3df1e0afd3475a87c4a)

    `extractPersistedSchema` can now be used to extra a JSON-compatible representation of the subset of a schema that gets stored in documents.
    This can be used write tests which snapshot an applications schema.
    Such tests can be used to detect schema changes which could would impact document compatibility,
    and can be combined with the new `comparePersistedSchema` to measure what kind of compatibility impact the schema change has.

-   Fix reading of `null` from unhydrated trees ([#22748](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/pull/22748)) [6a75bd0616](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/6a75bd0616ecd315ae0e9458d88ba1c755dfd785)

    Unhydrated trees containing object nodes with required fields set to `null` used to throw an error.
    This was a bug: `null` is a valid value in tree's whose schema allow it, and this specific case now correctly returns `null` values when appropriate without erroring.

-   âœ¨ New! Alpha SharedTree branching APIs ([#22550](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/pull/22550)) [8f4587c912](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/8f4587c912f955c405d7bbbc5b42f3ffc3b497d7)

    Several APIs have been added to allow for creating and coordinating "version-control"-style branches of the SharedTree.
    Use the `getBranch` entry point function to acquire a branch.
    For example:

    ```ts
    function makeEditOnBranch(mainView: TreeView<typeof MySchema>) {
    	mainView.root.myData = 3;
    	const mainBranch = getBranch(mainView); // This function accepts either a view of a SharedTree (acquired e.g. via `sharedTree.viewWith(...)`) or a `SharedTree` directly.
    	const forkBranch = mainBranch.branch(); // This creates a new branch based on the existing branch.
    	const forkView = forkBranch.viewWith(new TreeViewConfiguration({ schema: MySchema })); // Acquire a view of the forked branch in order to read or edit its tree.
    	forkView.root.myData = 4; // Set the value on the fork branch to be 4. The main branch still has a value of 3.
    	mainBranch.merge(forkBranch); // Merging the fork changes into the main branch causes the main branch to have a value of 4.

    	// Note: The main branch (and therefore, also the `forkView`) is automatically disposed by the merge.
    	// To prevent this, use `mainBranch.merge(forkBranch, false)`.
    }
    ```

    Merging any number of commits into a target branch (via the `TreeBranch.merge` method) generates a revertible for each
    commit on the target branch. See [#22644](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/pull/22644) for more information
    about revertible support in the branching APIs.

-   SharedTree's `RestrictiveReadonlyRecord` is deprecated ([#22479](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/pull/22479)) [8be73d374d](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/8be73d374de04ff6226c531ba8b562561572640f)

    `RestrictiveReadonlyRecord` was an attempt to implement a version of TypeScript's built-in `Record<TKey, TValue>` type that would prohibit (instead of leaving unrestricted like Record does) values under keys that do not extend `TKey`.

    The implementation of `RestrictiveReadonlyRecord` failed to accomplish this except for the edge cases where `TKey` was exactly `string` or exactly `symbol`.
    Fixing this bug appears to be impossible within the current limitation of TypeScript, however this library does not require any case other than `TKey` being exactly `string`.

    To reduce the risk of users of the tree library using the problematic `RestrictiveReadonlyRecord` type, it has been deprecated and replaced with a more specific type that avoids the bug, `RestrictiveStringRecord<TValue>`.

    To highlight that this new type is not intended for direct use by users of tree, and instead is just used as part of the typing of its public API, `RestrictiveStringRecord` has been tagged with `@system`.
    See [API Support Levels](https://fluidframework.com/docs/build/releases-and-apitags/#api-support-levels) for more details.

-   Fix `.create` on structurally named MapNode and ArrayNode schema ([#22522](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/pull/22522)) [b3f91ae91c](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/b3f91ae91cb750a6a7696ab5ea17c00895bb6d92)

    Constructing a structurally named MapNode or ArrayNode schema (using the overload of `SchemaFactory.map` or `SchemaFactory.array` which does not take an explicit name), returned a `TreeNodeSchema` instead of a `TreeNodeSchemaNonClass`, which resulted in the `create` static method not being exposed.
    This has been fixed, and can now be used as follows:

    ```typescript
    const MyMap = schemaFactory.map(schemaFactory.number);
    type MyMap = NodeFromSchema<typeof MyMap>;
    const _fromMap: MyMap = MyMap.create(new MyMap());
    const _fromIterable: MyMap = MyMap.create([]);
    const _fromObject: MyMap = MyMap.create({});
    ```

    This change causes some types to reference `TreeNodeSchemaNonClass` which did not reference it before.
    While `TreeNodeSchemaNonClass` is `@system` (See [Fluid Releases and API Support Levels
    ](https://fluidframework.com/docs/build/releases-and-apitags/) for details) and thus not intended to be referred to by users of Fluid,
    this change caused the TypeScript compiler to generate references to it in more cases when compiling `d.ts` files.
    Since the TypeScript compiler is unable to generate references to `TreeNodeSchemaNonClass` with how it was nested in `internalTypes.js`,
    this change could break the build of packages exporting types referencing structurally named map and array schema.
    This has been mitigated by moving `TreeNodeSchemaNonClass` out of `internalTypes.js`:
    any code importing `TreeNodeSchemaNonClass` (and thus disregarding the `@system` restriction) can be fixed by importing it from the top level instead of the `internalTypes.js`

-   Non-leaf field access has been optimized ([#22717](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/pull/22717)) [6a2b68103c](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/6a2b68103cc3ad56a9ac0dfcaaa8546978ec29ac)

    When reading non-leaf children which have been read previously, they are retrieved from cache faster.
    Several operations on subtrees under arrays have been optimized, including reading of non-leaf nodes for the first time.
    Overall this showed a roughly 5% speed up in a read heavy test application (the BubbleBench example) but gains are expected to vary a lot based on use-case.

-   âœ¨ New! Alpha APIs for producing SharedTree schema from enums ([#20035](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/pull/20035)) [5f9bbe011a](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/5f9bbe011a18ccac08a70340f6d20e60ce30c4a4)

    `adaptEnum` and `enumFromStrings` have been added to `@fluidframework/tree/alpha` and `fluid-framework/alpha`.
    These unstable alpha APIs are relatively simple helpers on-top of public APIs (source: [schemaCreationUtilities.ts](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/blob/main/packages/dds/tree/src/simple-tree/schemaCreationUtilities.ts)):
    thus if these change or stable alternatives are needed, an application can replicate this functionality using these implementations as an example.

## 2.3.0

### Minor Changes

-   Add /alpha import path to @fluidframework/tree and fluid-framework packages ([#22483](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/pull/22483)) [12242cfdb5a](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/12242cfdb5aa4c342cc62f11cbf1c072840bec44)

    `@fluidframework/tree` and `fluid-framework` now have a `/alpha` import path where their `@alpha` APIs are exported.

-   Export SharedTree beta APIs from fluid-framework/beta ([#22469](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/pull/22469)) [c51f55c01a6](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/c51f55c01a641eb030f872b684e2862e57ad5197)

    `fluid-framework/beta` now contains the `@beta` APIs from `@fluidframework/tree/beta`.

-   Implicitly constructed object nodes now only consider own properties during validation ([#22453](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/pull/22453)) [27faa56f5ae](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/27faa56f5ae334e0b65fdd84c75764645e64f063)

    When determining if some given data is compatible with a particular ObjectNode schema, both inherited and own properties were considered.
    However, when constructing the node from this data, only own properties were used.
    This allowed input which provided required values in inherited fields to pass validation.
    When the node was constructed, it would lack these fields, and end up out of schema.
    This has been fixed: both validation and node construction now only consider own properties.

    This may cause some cases which previously exhibited data corruption to now throw a usage error reporting the data is incompatible.
    Such cases may need to copy data from the objects with inherited properties into new objects with own properties before constructing nodes from them.

-   A `@beta` version of `nodeChanged` which includes the list of properties has been added ([#22229](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/pull/22229)) [aae34dd9fe1](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/aae34dd9fe1aa6c153c26035f1486f4d8944c810)

    ```typescript
    const factory = new SchemaFactory("example");
    class Point2d extends factory.object("Point2d", {
    	x: factory.number,
    	y: factory.number,
    }) {}

    const point = new Point2d({ x: 0, y: 0 });

    TreeBeta.on(point, "nodeChanged", (data) => {
    	const changed: ReadonlySet<"x" | "y"> = data.changedProperties;
    	if (changed.has("x")) {
    		// ...
    	}
    });
    ```

    The payload of the `nodeChanged` event emitted by SharedTree's `TreeBeta` includes a `changedProperties` property that indicates
    which properties of the node changed.

    For object nodes, the list of properties uses the property identifiers defined in the schema, and not the persisted
    identifiers (or "stored keys") that can be provided through `FieldProps` when defining a schema.
    See the documentation for `FieldProps` for more details about the distinction between "property keys" and "stored keys".

    For map nodes, every key that was added, removed, or updated by a change to the tree is included in the list of properties.

    For array nodes, the set of properties will always be undefined: there is currently no API to get details about changes to an array.

    Object nodes revieve strongly types sets of changed keys, allowing compile time detection of incorrect keys:

    ```typescript
    TreeBeta.on(point, "nodeChanged", (data) => {
    	// @ts-expect-error Strong typing for changed properties of object nodes detects incorrect keys:
    	if (data.changedProperties.has("z")) {
    		// ...
    	}
    });
    ```

    The existing stable "nodeChanged" event's callback now is given a parameter called `unstable` of type `unknown` which is used to indicate that additional data can be provided there.
    This could break existing code using "nodeChanged" in a particularly fragile way.

    ```typescript
    function f(optional?: number) {
    	// ...
    }
    Tree.on(point, "nodeChanged", f); // Bad
    ```

    Code like this which is implicitly discarding an optional argument from the function used as the listener will be broken.
    It can be fixed by using an inline lambda expression:

    ```typescript
    function f(optional?: number) {
    	// ...
    }
    Tree.on(point, "nodeChanged", () => f()); // Safe
    ```

## 2.2.0

### Minor Changes

-   The PropertyManager class and related functions and properties are deprecated ([#22183](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/pull/22183)) [cbba69554f](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/cbba69554fc5026f562f44683a902474fabd6e81)

    The `PropertyManager` class, along with the `propertyManager` properties and `addProperties` functions on segments and intervals, are not intended for external use.
    These elements will be removed in a future release for the following reasons:

    -   There are no scenarios where they need to be used directly.
    -   Using them directly will cause eventual consistency problems.
    -   Upcoming features will require modifications to these mechanisms.

-   Compile-time type narrowing based on a TreeNode's NodeKind ([#22222](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/pull/22222)) [4d3bc876ae](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/4d3bc876ae32fa3f2568299e29246f6970e48ee0)

    `TreeNode`'s schema-aware APIs implement `WithType`, which now has a `NodeKind` parameter that can be used to narrow `TreeNode`s based on `NodeKind`.

    Example:

    ```typescript
    function getKeys(node: TreeNode & WithType<string, NodeKind.Array>): number[];
    function getKeys(node: TreeNode & WithType<string, NodeKind.Map | NodeKind.Object>): string[];
    function getKeys(node: TreeNode): string[] | number[];
    function getKeys(node: TreeNode): string[] | number[] {
    	const schema = Tree.schema(node);
    	switch (schema.kind) {
    		case NodeKind.Array: {
    			const arrayNode = node as TreeArrayNode;
    			const keys: number[] = [];
    			for (let index = 0; index < arrayNode.length; index++) {
    				keys.push(index);
    			}
    			return keys;
    		}
    		case NodeKind.Map:
    			return [...(node as TreeMapNode).keys()];
    		case NodeKind.Object:
    			return Object.keys(node);
    		default:
    			throw new Error("Unsupported Kind");
    	}
    }
    ```

-   âœ¨ New! `Record`-typed objects can now be used to construct MapNodes ([#22042](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/pull/22042)) [25deff344b](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/25deff344b447380486c1efb64ed69177c32ddc5)

    You can now construct MapNodes from `Record` typed objects, similar to how maps are expressed in JSON.

    Before this change, an `Iterable<string, Child>` was required, but now an object like `{key1: Child1, key2: Child2}` is allowed.

    Full example using this new API:

    ```typescript
    class Schema extends schemaFactory.map("ExampleMap", schemaFactory.number) {}
    const fromRecord = new Schema({ x: 5 });
    ```

    This new feature makes it possible for schemas to construct a tree entirely from JSON-compatible objects using their constructors,
    as long as they do not require unhydrated nodes to differentiate ambiguous unions,
    or IFluidHandles (which themselves are not JSON compatible).

    Due to limitations of TypeScript and recursive types,
    recursive maps do not advertise support for this feature in their typing,
    but it works at runtime.

-   New SharedTree configuration option: `ITreeConfigurationOptions.preventAmbiguity` ([#22048](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/pull/22048)) [966906a034](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/966906a03490daa5a914030b37342abb8267c12d)

    The new `ITreeConfigurationOptions.preventAmbiguity` flag can be set to true to enable checking of some additional rules when constructing the `TreeViewConfiguration`.

    This example shows an ambiguous schema:

    ```typescript
    const schemaFactory = new SchemaFactory("com.example");
    class Feet extends schemaFactory.object("Feet", { length: schemaFactory.number }) {}
    class Meters extends schemaFactory.object("Meters", { length: schemaFactory.number }) {}
    const config = new TreeViewConfiguration({
    	// This combination of schema can lead to ambiguous cases, and will error since preventAmbiguity is true.
    	schema: [Feet, Meters],
    	preventAmbiguity: true,
    });
    const view = tree.viewWith(config);
    // This is invalid since it is ambiguous which type of node is being constructed.
    // The error thrown above when constructing the TreeViewConfiguration is because of this ambiguous case:
    view.initialize({ length: 5 });
    ```

    See the documentation on `ITreeConfigurationOptions.preventAmbiguity` for a more complete example and more details.

-   `Tree.schema` now returns `TreeNodeSchema` ([#22185](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/pull/22185)) [bfe8310a94](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/bfe8310a9406a8658c2fac8827c7114844c32234)

    The typing of `Tree.schema` has changed from:

    ```typescript
    schema<T extends TreeNode | TreeLeafValue>(node: T): TreeNodeSchema<string, NodeKind, unknown, T>;
    ```

    to:

    ```typescript
    schema(node: TreeNode | TreeLeafValue): TreeNodeSchema;
    ```

    The runtime behavior is unaffected: any code which worked and still compiles is fine and does not need changes.

    `Tree.schema` was changed to mitigate two different issues:

    1. It tried to give a more specific type based on the type of the passed in value.
       When the type of the input is not known precisely (for example it is a union of node types like `Foo | Bar`, or `TreeNode` or even `TreeNode | TreeLeafValue`), this was fine since schema are covariant over their node type.
       However when the input was more specific that the schema type, for example the type is simply `0`, this would result in unsound typing, since the create function could actually return values that did not conform with that schema (for example `schema.create(1)` for the number schema typed with `0` would return `1` with type `0`).
    2. The node type was provided to the incorrect type parameter of TreeNodeSchema.
       The `TNode` parameter is the third one, not the fourth.
       The fourth is `TBuild` which sets the input accepted to its create function or constructor.
       Thus this code accidentally left `TNode` unset (which is good due to the above issue), but invalidly set `TBuild`.
       `TBuild` is contravariant, so it has the opposite issue that setting `TNode` would have: if your input is simply typed as something general like `TreeNode`, then the returned schema would claim to be able to construct an instance given any `TreeNode`.
       This is incorrect, and this typing has been removed.

    Fortunately it should be rare for code to be impacted by this issue.
    Any code which manually specified a generic type parameter to `Tree.schema()` will break, as well as code which assigned its result to an overly specifically typed variable.
    Code which used `typeof` on the returned schema could also break, though there are few use-cases for this so such code is not expected to exist.
    Currently it's very difficult to invoke the create function or constructor associated with a `TreeNodeSchema` as doing so already requires narrowing to `TreeNodeSchemaClass` or `TreeNodeSchemaNonClass`.
    It is possible some such code exists which will need to have an explicit cast added because it happened to work with the more specific (but incorrect) constructor input type.

-   Recursive SharedTree schemas using MapNodes no longer produce invalid d.ts files ([#22106](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/pull/22106)) [554fc5a94e](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/554fc5a94e57e2d109ea9008b7c64517c58a6b73)

    Consider a recursive SharedTree schema like the following, which follows all our recommended best practices:

    ```typescript
    export class RecursiveMap extends schema.mapRecursive("RM", [() => RecursiveMap]) {}
    {
    	type _check = ValidateRecursiveSchema<typeof RecursiveMap>;
    }
    ```

    This schema would work when used from within its compilation unit, but would generate d.ts that fails to compile when exporting it:

    ```typescript
    declare const RecursiveMap_base: import("@fluidframework/tree").TreeNodeSchemaClass<
    	"com.example.RM",
    	import("@fluidframework/tree").NodeKind.Map,
    	import("@fluidframework/tree").TreeMapNodeUnsafe<readonly [() => typeof RecursiveMap]> &
    		import("@fluidframework/tree").WithType<"com.example.RM">,
    	{
    		[Symbol.iterator](): Iterator<[string, RecursiveMap], any, undefined>;
    	},
    	false,
    	readonly [() => typeof RecursiveMap]
    >;
    export declare class RecursiveMap extends RecursiveMap_base {}
    ```

    This results in the compile error in TypeScript 5.4.5:

    > error TS2310: Type 'RecursiveMap' recursively references itself as a base type.

    With this change, that error is fixed by modifying the `TreeMapNodeUnsafe` type it references to inline the definition of `ReadonlyMap` instead of using the one from the TypeScript standard library.

-   âœ¨ New! When unambiguous, ArrayNodes can now be constructed from Maps and MapNodes from arrays ([#22036](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/pull/22036)) [25e74f9f3b](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/25e74f9f3bed6e6ff041c088813c4cc1ea276b9c)

    Since the types for ArrayNodes and MapNodes indicate they can be constructed from iterables,
    it should work, even if those iterables are themselves arrays or maps.
    To avoid this being a breaking change, a priority system was introduced.
    ArrayNodes will only be implicitly constructable from JavaScript Map objects in contexts where no MapNodes are allowed.
    Similarly MapNodes will only be implicitly constructable from JavaScript Array objects in contexts where no ArrayNodes are allowed.

    In practice, the main case in which this is likely to matter is when implicitly constructing a map node. If you provide an array of key value pairs, this now works instead of erroring, as long as no ArrayNode is valid at that location in the tree.

    ```typescript
    class MyMapNode extends schemaFactory.map("x", schemaFactory.number) {}
    class Root extends schemaFactory.object("root", { data: MyMapNode }) {}
    // This now works (before it compiled, but error at runtime):
    const fromArray = new Root({ data: [["x", 5]] });
    ```

    Prior versions used to have to do:

    ```typescript
    new Root({ data: new MyMapNode([["x", 5]]) });
    ```

    or:

    ```typescript
    new Root({ data: new Map([["x", 5]]) });
    ```

    Both of these options still work: strictly more cases are allowed with this change.

-   Implicit TreeNode construction improvements ([#21995](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/pull/21995)) [977f96c1a0](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/977f96c1a0dd1d5eb0dbcd087d07cb7510d533ea)

    ArrayNodes and MapNodes could always be explicitly constructed (using `new`) from iterables.
    The types also allowed using of iterables to implicitly construct array nodes and map nodes,
    but this did not work at runtime.
    This has been fixed for all cases except implicitly constructing an ArrayNode form an `Iterable` that is actually a `Map`,
    and implicitly constructing a MapNode from an `Iterable` that is actually an `Array`.
    These cases may be fixed in the future, but require additional work to ensure unions of array nodes and map nodes work correctly.

    Additionally MapNodes can now be constructed from `Iterator<readonly [string, content]>` where previously the inner arrays had to be mutable.

-   Enforce use of TreeViewConfiguration's constructor ([#22055](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/pull/22055)) [e8955579f6](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/e8955579f6d52a6c7e300642088c60d6ed12d7db)

    `TreeViewConfiguration` is `@sealed`, meaning creating custom implementations of it such as assigning object literals to a `TreeViewConfiguration` or sub-classing it are not supported.
    This reserved the ability for the Fluid Framework to add members to this class over time, informing users that they must use it in such a way where such changes are non-breaking.
    However, there was no compiler-based enforcement of this expectation.
    It was only indicated via documentation and an implicit assumption that when an API takes in a typed defined as a class, that an instance of that class must be used rather than an arbitrary object of a similar shape.

    With this change, the TypeScript compiler will now inform users when they invalidly provide an object literal as a `TreeViewConfiguration`.

    More specifically this causes code like this to produce a compile error:

    ```typescript
    // Don't do this!
    const view = tree.viewWith({ schema: TestNode, enableSchemaValidation: false });
    ```

    The above was never intended to work, and is not a supported use of the `viewWith` since it requires a `TreeViewConfiguration` which is sealed.
    Any code using the above pattern will break in Fluid Framework 2.2 and above. Such code will need to be updated to the pattern shown below.
    Any code broken by this change is technically unsupported and only worked due to a gap in the type checking. This is not considered a breaking change.
    The correct way to get a `TreeViewConfiguration` is by using its constructor:

    ```typescript
    // This pattern correctly initializes default values and validates input.
    const view = tree.viewWith(new TreeViewConfiguration({ schema: TestNode }));
    ```

    Skipping the constructor causes the following problems:

    1. `TreeViewConfiguration` does validation in its constructor, so skipping it also skips the validation which leads to much less friendly error messages for invalid schema.
    2. Skipping the constructor also discards any default values for options like `enableSchemaValidation`.
       This means that code written in that style would break if more options were added. Since such changes are planned,
       it is not practical to support this pattern.

-   New `isFluidHandle` type guard to check if an object is an `IFluidHandle` ([#22029](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/pull/22029)) [7827d1040a](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/7827d1040a9ebc0bd11388dc31f15370ea9f68d3)

    The `isFluidHandle` type guard function is now exported and can be used to detect which objects are `IFluidHandle`s.
    Since `IFluidHandle` often needs special handling (for example when serializing since it's not JSON compatible),
    having a dedicated detection function for it is useful.
    Doing this detection was possible previously using the `tree` package's schema system via `Tree.is(value, new SchemaFactory("").handle)`,
    but can now be done with just `isFluidHandle(value)`.

-   Add a function `isRepoSuperset` to determine if changes to a document schema are backward-compatible ([#22045](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/pull/22045)) [f6fdc95bb3](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/f6fdc95bb36a892710bc315aae85fd2c75aec975)

    Note: These changes are not customer-facing and make progress toward future plans in Tree's schema evolution space.

## 2.1.0

### Minor Changes

-   Detect arrayNode iterator invalidation ([#21760](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/pull/21760)) [6fd320c385](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/6fd320c38561e272a1acaf4248f47fc386c650e4)

    When `arrayNode`s are edited concurrently during iteration, an error will be thrown.

-   Some SharedDirectory/SharedMap-related APIs have been sealed ([#21836](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/pull/21836)) [b1d0427eab](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/b1d0427eab3fcd55588dd80996967133db66f1b8)

    Note that this is a _documentation only change._ There is no runtime or type-level impact.

    Some top-level APIs within `@fluidframework/map` and `fluid-framework` have been updated to reflect their
    sealed/readonly nature. That is, they are not to be implemented externally to Fluid Framework and not changed. This was
    already the case, but the documentation was not clear.

    Updated APIs:

    -   [IDirectory](https://fluidframework.com/docs/api/v2/fluid-framework/idirectory-interface) sealed
    -   [IDirectoryEvents](https://fluidframework.com/docs/api/v2/fluid-framework/idirectoryevents-interface) sealed
    -   [IDirectoryValueChanged](https://fluidframework.com/docs/api/v2/fluid-framework/idirectoryvaluechanged-interface) sealed and path property is readonly
    -   [ISharedDirectory](https://fluidframework.com/docs/api/v2/fluid-framework/ishareddirectory-interface) sealed
    -   [ISharedDirectoryEvents](https://fluidframework.com/docs/api/v2/fluid-framework/ishareddirectoryevents-interface) sealed
    -   [IValueChanged](https://fluidframework.com/docs/api/v2/fluid-framework/ivaluechanged-interface) sealed

-   tree: Improved performance for accessing identifiers in shortId API ([#21944](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/pull/21944)) [6b4cf26d9c](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/6b4cf26d9cc14c1a36cf07fd7408f1d1227e373a)

    Users should see improved performance when calling the `Tree.shortId` API. Identifier field keys are now cached in the schema for faster access.

-   âœ¨ New! Debug visualizers for TreeNodes in NodeJS and browsers ([#21895](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/pull/21895)) [0d197fefec](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/0d197fefec852df2911151217ac1b71cde528a70)

    TreeNodes now have custom debug visualizers to improve the debug experience in NodeJS and in browsers. Note that custom formatters must be enabled in the browser developer tools for that visualizer to be used.

-   Using "delete" on tree fields now throws an error instead of not working correctly ([#21609](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/pull/21609)) [416849b1fd](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/416849b1fda029870ee1c1742100de4f8dde45b7)

    TypeScript allows `delete` on object node optional fields if the `exactOptionalPropertyTypes` tsconfig setting is not
    enabled. This does not work correctly at runtime and now produces an informative error.

-   Improved error reporting ([#21940](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/pull/21940)) [3b8a366dd1](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/3b8a366dd15660f9c916832040faf772534c0755)

    Several cases of invalid usage patterns for tree APIs have gained improved error reporting, as well as improved documentation on the APIs detailing what usage is supported.
    These improvements include:

    -   Unsupported usages of schema classes: using more than one schema class derived from a single SchemaFactory generated base class. This used to hit internal asserts, but now has a descriptive user-facing UsageError. Most of this work was done in [9fb3dcf](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/9fb3dcf491a7f0d66f4abbdc64ab97ccabef4707).
    -   Improved detection of when prior exception may have left SharedTree in an invalid state.
        These cases now report a UsageError including a reference to the prior exception. This was mainly done in [9fb3dcf](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/9fb3dcf491a7f0d66f4abbdc64ab97ccabef4707) and [b77d530](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/b77d530b9252201c40a90d1a2a6315f76f1a4a4b).

## 2.0.0-rc.5.0.0

### Minor Changes

-   fluid-framework: Type Erase ISharedObjectKind ([#21081](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/pull/21081)) [78f228e370](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/78f228e37055bd4d9a8f02b3a1eefebf4da9c59c)

    A new type, `SharedObjectKind` is added as a type erased version of `ISharedObjectKind` and `DataObjectClass`.

    This type fills the role of both `ISharedObjectKind` and `DataObjectClass` in the `@public` "declarative API" exposed in the `fluid-framework` package.

    This allows several types referenced by `ISharedObjectKind` to be made `@alpha` as they should only need to be used by legacy code and users of the unstable/alpha/legacy "encapsulated API".

    Access to these now less public types should not be required for users of the `@public` "declarative API" exposed in the `fluid-framework` package, but can still be accessed for those who need them under the `/legacy` import paths.
    The full list of such types is:

    -   `SharedTree` as exported from `@fluidframwork/tree`: It is still exported as `@public` from `fluid-framework` as `SharedObjectKind`.
    -   `ISharedObjectKind`: See new `SharedObjectKind` type for use in `@public` APIs.
        `ISharedObject`
    -   `IChannel`
    -   `IChannelAttributes`
    -   `IChannelFactory`
    -   `IExperimentalIncrementalSummaryContext`
    -   `IGarbageCollectionData`
    -   `ISummaryStats`
    -   `ISummaryTreeWithStats`
    -   `ITelemetryContext`
    -   `IDeltaManagerErased`
    -   `IFluidDataStoreRuntimeEvents`
    -   `IFluidHandleContext`
    -   `IProvideFluidHandleContext`

    Removed APIs:

    -   `DataObjectClass`: Usages replaced with `SharedObjectKind`.
    -   `LoadableObjectClass`: Replaced with `SharedObjectKind`.
    -   `LoadableObjectClassRecord`: Replaced with `Record<string, SharedObjectKind>`.
    -

-   tree: Added support for optional schema validation on newly inserted content in SharedTree ([#21011](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/pull/21011)) [b14e9fa607](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/b14e9fa607a8281f86d0cfac631e33ef12033e21)

    When defining how to view a SharedTree, an application can now specify that new content inserted into the tree should
    be subject to schema validation at the time it is inserted, so if it's not valid according to the stored schema in the
    tree an error is thrown immediately.

    This can be accomplished by passing an `ITreeConfigurationOptions` argument with `enableSchemaValidation` set to `true`
    when creating a `TreeConfiguration` to use with the SharedTree.

    Since this feature requires additional compute when inserting new content into the tree, it is not enabled by default.

-   Update to TypeScript 5.4 ([#21214](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/pull/21214)) [0e6256c722](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/0e6256c722d8bf024f4325bf02547daeeb18bfa6)

    Update package implementations to use TypeScript 5.4.5.

-   fluid-framework: Remove some types from `@public` that are not needed ([#21326](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/pull/21326)) [b629cb80b0](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/b629cb80b0e5ecdc750270807f77a0e30fab4559)

    Mark the following APIs `@alpha` instead of `@public`:

    -   IBranchOrigin
    -   ISequencedDocumentMessage
    -   ISignalMessage
    -   ISignalMessageBase
    -   ITrace

-   tree: A new tree status has been added for SharedTree nodes. ([#21270](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/pull/21270)) [8760e321b0](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/8760e321b02177babfb187ae293a17a65723f249)

    `TreeStatus.Created` indicates that a SharedTree node has been constructed but not yet inserted into the tree.
    Constraints passed to the `runTransaction` API are now marked as `readonly`.

-   fluid-framework: Remove several types from `@public` scope ([#21142](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/pull/21142)) [983e9f09f7](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/983e9f09f7b10fef9ffa1e9af86166f0ccda7e14)

    The following types have been moved from `@public` to `@alpha`:

    -   `IFluidSerializer`
    -   `ISharedObjectEvents`
    -   `IChannelServices`
    -   `IChannelStorageService`
    -   `IDeltaConnection`
    -   `IDeltaHandler`

    These should not be needed by users of the declarative API, which is what `@public` is targeting.

-   sequence: Stop ISharedString extending SharedObject ([#21067](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/pull/21067)) [47465f4b12](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/47465f4b12056810112df30a6dad89282afc7a2d)

    ISharedString no longer extends SharedSegmentSequence and instead extends the new ISharedSegmentSequence, which may be missing some APIs.

    Attempt to migrate off the missing APIs, but if that is not practical, request they be added to ISharedSegmentSequence and cast to SharedSegmentSequence as a workaround temporally.

-   Update to ES 2022 ([#21292](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/pull/21292)) [68921502f7](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/68921502f79b1833c4cd6d0fe339bfb126a712c7)

    Update tsconfig to target ES 2022.

-   tree: Move several types into InternalTypes ([#21482](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/pull/21482)) [64d49dd362](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/64d49dd3629cefe6260a1d6223e58b10c2ac0cb6)

    The stable public API surface for Tree has been reduced.
    Several types have been moved into InternalTypes, indicating that they are not fully stable nor intended to be referenced by users of Tree.

    -   NodeBuilderData
    -   FieldHasDefault
    -   TreeNodeSchemaNonClass
    -   TreeArrayNodeBase
    -   ScopedSchemaName
    -   DefaultProvider
    -   typeNameSymbol
    -   InsertableObjectFromSchemaRecord
    -   ObjectFromSchemaRecord
    -   FieldHasDefaultUnsafe
    -   ObjectFromSchemaRecordUnsafe
    -   TreeObjectNodeUnsafe
    -   TreeFieldFromImplicitFieldUnsafe
    -   TreeNodeFromImplicitAllowedTypesUnsafe
    -   InsertableTreeNodeFromImplicitAllowedTypesUnsafe
    -   TreeArrayNodeUnsafe
    -   TreeMapNodeUnsafe
    -   InsertableObjectFromSchemaRecordUnsafe
    -   InsertableTreeFieldFromImplicitFieldUnsafe
    -   InsertableTypedNodeUnsafe
    -   NodeBuilderDataUnsafe
    -   NodeFromSchemaUnsafe
    -   FlexList
    -   TreeApi

    Additionally a few more types which could not be moved due to technically limitations have been documented that they should be treated similarly.

    -   TreeNodeApi
    -   TreeNodeSchemaCore
    -   All \*Unsafe type (use for construction of recursive schema).
    -   WithType
    -   AllowedTypes
    -   FieldSchemaUnsafe

    Also to reduce confusion `type` was renamed to `typeNameSymbol`, and is now only type exported. `Tree.is` should be used to get type information from `TreeNodes` instead.

-   tree: object node fields with statically known default values are now optional ([#21193](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/pull/21193)) [21eac41660](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/21eac41660944208bad42b156d7df05fe6dc6b97)

    Makes object node fields with statically known default values (i.e., `optional` and `identifier` fields) optional when creating trees, where they were previously required.

    Example:

    ```typescript
    class Foo extends schemaFactory.object("Foo", {
    	name: schemaFactory.string,
    	id: schemaFactory.identifier,
    	nickname: schemaFactory.optional(schemaFactory.string),
    }) {}

    // Before
    const foo = new Foo({
    	name: "Bar",
    	id: undefined, // Had to explicitly specify `undefined` to opt into default behavior
    	nickname: undefined, // Had to explicitly specify `undefined` for optional field
    });

    // After
    const foo = new Foo({
    	name: "Bar",
    	// Can omit `id` and `nickname` fields, as both have statically known defaults!
    });
    ```

-   tree: Breaking change: `TreeStatus.Created` is now `TreeStatus.New` ([#21278](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/pull/21278)) [5a26346a14](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/5a26346a145ed54d08cd5a9b4f1c9b177711bd7c)

    `TreeStatus.Created` has been renamed to `TreeStatus.New`.

-   core-interfaces, tree: Unify `IDisposable` interfaces ([#21184](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/pull/21184)) [cfcb827851](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/cfcb827851ffc81486db6c718380150189fb95c5)

    Public APIs in `@fluidframework/tree` now use `IDisposable` from `@fluidframework/core-interfaces` replacing `disposeSymbol` with "dispose".

    `IDisposable` in `@fluidframework/core-interfaces` is now `@sealed` indicating that third parties should not implement it to reserve the ability for Fluid Framework to extend it to include `Symbol.dispose` as a future non-breaking change.

-   fluid-framework: Cleanup `fluid-framework` legacy exports ([#21153](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/pull/21153)) [efee21c296](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/efee21c2965a02288db6e0345fcf9b3713210953)

    Cleanup `fluid-framework` legacy exports to remove no longer required types.

## 2.0.0-rc.4.0.0

### Minor Changes

-   SharedString now uses ISharedObjectKind and does not export the factory [96872186d0](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/96872186d0d0f245c1fece7d19b3743e501679b6)

    Most users of `SharedString` should be unaffected as long as they stick to the factory patterns supported by ISharedObjectKind.
    If the actual class type is needed it can be found as `SharedStringClass`.

-   Deprecated members of IFluidHandle are split off into new IFluidHandleInternal interface [96872186d0](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/96872186d0d0f245c1fece7d19b3743e501679b6)

    Split IFluidHandle into two interfaces, `IFluidHandle` and `IFluidHandleInternal`.
    Code depending on the previously deprecated members of IFluidHandle can access them by using `toFluidHandleInternal` from `@fluidframework/runtime-utils/legacy`.

    External implementation of the `IFluidHandle` interface are not supported: this change makes the typing better convey this using the `ErasedType` pattern.
    Any existing and previously working, and now broken, external implementations of `IFluidHandle` should still work at runtime, but will need some unsafe type casts to compile.
    Such handle implementation may break in the future and thus should be replaced with use of handles produced by the Fluid Framework client packages.

-   Minor API fixes for "@fluidframework/tree" package. [96872186d0](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/96872186d0d0f245c1fece7d19b3743e501679b6)

    Changes constructor for `FieldSchema` from public to private. Users should call `makeFieldSchema` to create instance of `FieldSchema`.

-   Make several driver types no longer public [b7ad7d0b55](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/b7ad7d0b55884dd8954abf7c398e518838b9bda0)

    Move the following types from `@public` to `@alpha`:

    -   ITokenClaims
    -   IDocumentMessage
    -   IClientConfiguration
    -   IAnyDriverError
    -   IDriverErrorBase
    -   DriverErrorTypes

    `DriverErrorTypes` is no longer exported from the `fluid-framework` package.

-   Rename `AzureMember.userName` to `AzureMember.name` and `IMember.userId` to `IMember.id` [96872186d0](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/96872186d0d0f245c1fece7d19b3743e501679b6)

    1. Renamed `AzureMember.userName` to `AzureMember.name` to establish uniform naming across odsp-client and azure-client.
    2. Renamed `IMember.userId` to `IMember.id` to align with the properties received from AFR.

## 2.0.0-rc.3.0.0

### Major Changes

-   fluid-framework: DDS classes are no longer publicly exported [97d68aa06b](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/97d68aa06bd5c022ecb026655814aea222a062ae)

    SharedDirectory now only exports its factory and the interface type.
    The actual concrete classes which leak implementation details are no longer exported.
    Users of the `SharedDirectory` type should use `ISharedDirectory`.

    Most of other internal crufts are also hided within the API surface, such as the encoded format,
    ILocalValue, ICreateInfo, local op metadata types, etc.

-   Packages now use package.json "exports" and require modern module resolution [97d68aa06b](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/97d68aa06bd5c022ecb026655814aea222a062ae)

    Fluid Framework packages have been updated to use the [package.json "exports"
    field](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v18.x/api/packages.html#exports) to define explicit entry points for both
    TypeScript types and implementation code.

    This means that using Fluid Framework packages require the following TypeScript settings in tsconfig.json:

    -   `"moduleResolution": "Node16"` with `"module": "Node16"`
    -   `"moduleResolution": "Bundler"` with `"module": "ESNext"`

    We recommend using Node16/Node16 unless absolutely necessary. That will produce transpiled JavaScript that is suitable
    for use with modern versions of Node.js _and_ Bundlers.
    [See the TypeScript documentation](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#moduleResolution) for more information
    regarding the module and moduleResolution options.

    **Node10 moduleResolution is not supported; it does not support Fluid Framework's API structuring pattern that is used
    to distinguish stable APIs from those that are in development.**

### Minor Changes

-   tree: Allow root editing and make TreeView parameterized over schema. [97d68aa06b](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/97d68aa06bd5c022ecb026655814aea222a062ae)

    TreeView now is parameterized over the field schema instead of the root field type. This was needed to infer the correct input type when reassigning the root.
    Code providing an explicit type to TreeView, like `TreeView<Foo>` can usually be updated by replacing that with `TreeView<typeof Foo>`.

-   fluid-framework: Replace SharedObjectClass with new ISharedObjectKind type. [97d68aa06b](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/97d68aa06bd5c022ecb026655814aea222a062ae)

    The static objects used as SharedObjectClass now explicitly implement the new ISharedObjectKind type.
    SharedObjectClass has been removed as ISharedObjectKind now fills that role.
    LoadableObjectCtor has been inlined as it only had one use: an external user of it can replace it with `(new (...args: any[]) => T)`.

-   fluid-framework: Moved SharedMap to 'fluid-framework/legacy' [97d68aa06b](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/97d68aa06bd5c022ecb026655814aea222a062ae)

    Please use SharedTree for new containers. SharedMap is supported for loading preexisting Fluid Framework 1.x containers only.

    Fluid Framework 1.x users migrating to Fluid Framework 2.x will need to import SharedMap from the './legacy' import path.

    ```ts
    import { SharedMap } from "fluid-framework/legacy";
    ```

-   fluid-framework: Make some interface members readonly [97d68aa06b](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/97d68aa06bd5c022ecb026655814aea222a062ae)

    Remove unneeded mutability from some interface members.

## 2.0.0-rc.2.0.0

### Minor Changes

-   fluid-framework: EventEmitterWithErrorHandling is no longer publicly exported ([#19717](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/issues/19717)) [ae1d0be26d](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/ae1d0be26d61453cff316b3f622a9f3647149167)

    EventEmitterWithErrorHandling is intended for authoring DDSes, and thus is only intended for use within the Fluid Framework client packages.
    It is no longer publicly exported: any users should fine their own solution or be upstreamed.
    EventEmitterWithErrorHandling is available for now as `@alpha` to make this migration less disrupting for any existing users.

-   fluid-framework: SharedObject classes are no longer exported as public ([#19717](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/issues/19717)) [ae1d0be26d](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/ae1d0be26d61453cff316b3f622a9f3647149167)

    `SharedObject` and `SharedObjectCore` are intended for authoring DDSes, and thus are only intended for use within the Fluid Framework client packages.
    They is no longer publicly exported: any users should fine their own solution or be upstreamed.
    `SharedObject` and `SharedObjectCore` are available for now as `@alpha` to make this migration less disrupting for any existing users.

-   API tightening ([#20012](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/issues/20012)) [049de899dd](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/049de899ddfd5c0155251cb0ea00ecbe3a7f7665)

    The Fluid Framework API has been clarified with tags applied to package exports. As we are working toward a clear, safe,
    and stable API surface, some build settings and imports may need to be adjusted.

    **Now:** Most packages are specifying "exports" - import specifierss like` @fluidframework/foo/lib/internals` will
    become build errors. The fix is to use only public APIs from @fluidframework/foo.

    **Coming soon:** Build resolutions (`moduleResolution` in tsconfig compilerOptions) will need to be resolved with
    Node16, NodeNext, or a bundler that supports resolution of named import/export paths. Internally, some FF packages will
    use `@fluidframework/foo/internal` import paths that allow packages to talk to each other using non-public APIs.

    **Final stage:** APIs that are not tagged @public will be removed from @fluidframework/foo imports.

-   Deprecated error-related enums have been removed ([#19067](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/issues/19067)) [59793302e5](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/59793302e56784cfb6ace0e6469345f3565b3312)

    Error-related enums `ContainerErrorType`, `DriverErrorType`, `OdspErrorType` and `RouterliciousErrorType` were previously
    deprecated and are now removed. There are replacement object-based enumerations of `ContainerErrorTypes`,
    `DriverErrorTypes`, `OdspErrorTypes` and `RouterliciousErrorTypes`. Refer to the release notes of [Fluid Framework version
    2.0.0-internal.7.0.0](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/releases/tag/client_v2.0.0-internal.7.0.0) for details
    on the replacements.

-   map, tree: DDS classes are no longer publicly exported ([#19717](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/issues/19717)) [ae1d0be26d](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/ae1d0be26d61453cff316b3f622a9f3647149167)

    SharedMap and SharedTree now only export their factories and the interface types.
    The actual concrete classes which leak implementation details are no longer exported.
    Users of the `SharedMap` type should use `ISharedMap`.
    Users of the `SharedTree` type should use `ISharedTree`.

-   tree: Minor API fixes for "@fluidframework/tree" package. ([#19057](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/issues/19057)) [3e0f218832](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/3e0f21883255317f8bb1f7c420543650502a5b66)

    Rename `IterableTreeListContent` to `IterableTreeArrayContent`, inline `TreeMapNodeBase` into `TreeMapNode`, rename `TreeArrayNode.spread` to `TreeArrayNode.spread` and remove `create` which was not supposed to be public (use `TreeArrayNode.spread` instead).

-   fluid-framework: ContainerSchema is now readonly ([#19717](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/issues/19717)) [ae1d0be26d](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/ae1d0be26d61453cff316b3f622a9f3647149167)

    The `ContainerSchema` type is intended for defining input to these packages. This should make the APIs more tolerant and
    thus be non-breaking, however its possible for some users of `ContainerSchema` to use it in ways where this could be a
    breaking change: any such users should remove their mutations and/or use a different type.

### Major Changes

-   azure-client: Removed deprecated FluidStatic classes [9a451d4946](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/9a451d4946b5c51a52e4d1ab5bf51e7b285b0d74)

    Several FluidStatic classes were unnecessarily exposed and were deprecated in an earlier release. They have been replaced with creation functions. This helps us
    keep implementations decoupled from usage which is easier to maintain and extend. It has very minimal impact on the
    public surface area of downstream packages. The removed classes are as follows:

    -   `AzureAudience` (use `IAzureAudience` instead)
    -   `TinyliciousAudience` (use `ITinyliciousAudience` instead)
    -   `DOProviderContainerRuntimeFactory`
    -   `FluidContainer`
    -   `ServiceAudience`

### Major Changes

-   IntervalConflictResolver removed [8abce8cdb4](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/8abce8cdb4e2832fb6405fb44e393bef03d5648a)

    IntervalConflictResolver has been removed. Any lingering usages in application code can be removed as well. This change also marks APIs deprecated in #14318 as internal.

-   RootDataObject and RootDataObjectProps no longer exported from fluid-static or fluid-framework packages [8abce8cdb4](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/8abce8cdb4e2832fb6405fb44e393bef03d5648a)

    RootDataObject and RootDataObjectProps are internal implementations and not intended for direct use. Instead use IRootDataObject to refer to the root data object.

-   Upgraded typescript transpilation target to ES2020 [8abce8cdb4](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/8abce8cdb4e2832fb6405fb44e393bef03d5648a)

    Upgraded typescript transpilation target to ES2020. This is done in order to decrease the bundle sizes of Fluid Framework packages. This has provided size improvements across the board for ex. Loader, Driver, Runtime etc. Reduced bundle sizes helps to load lesser code in apps and hence also helps to improve the perf.If any app wants to target any older versions of browsers with which this target version is not compatible, then they can use packages like babel to transpile to a older target.
