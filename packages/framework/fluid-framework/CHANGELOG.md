### Major Changes

-   IntervalConflictResolver removed [8abce8cdb4](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/8abce8cdb4e2832fb6405fb44e393bef03d5648a)

    IntervalConflictResolver has been removed. Any lingering usages in application code can be removed as well. This change also marks APIs deprecated in #14318 as internal.

-   RootDataObject and RootDataObjectProps no longer exported from fluid-static or fluid-framework packages [8abce8cdb4](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/8abce8cdb4e2832fb6405fb44e393bef03d5648a)

    RootDataObject and RootDataObjectProps are internal implementations and not intended for direct use. Instead use IRootDataObject to refer to the root data object.

-   Upgraded typescript transpilation target to ES2020 [8abce8cdb4](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/8abce8cdb4e2832fb6405fb44e393bef03d5648a)

    Upgraded typescript transpilation target to ES2020. This is done in order to decrease the bundle sizes of Fluid Framework packages. This has provided size improvements across the board for ex. Loader, Driver, Runtime etc. Reduced bundle sizes helps to load lesser code in apps and hence also helps to improve the perf.If any app wants to target any older versions of browsers with which this target version is not compatible, then they can use packages like babel to transpile to a older target.
