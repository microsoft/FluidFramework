# fluid-framework

The `fluid-framework` package bundles a collection of Fluid Framework client libraries for easy use when paired with a corresponding service client package (e.g. `@fluidframework/azure-client`, `@fluidframework/tinylicious-client`, or `@fluidframework/odsp-client (BETA)`).

This package reexports these APIs from other Fluid client packages reducing the number of direct package dependencies needed.
There are some packages there are not included as part of this `fluid-framework` package which users may want to use with this package:

-   A service client (e.g. `@fluidframework/azure-client`, `@fluidframework/odsp-client (BETA)`, or `@fluidframework/tinylicious-client` for local development) to allow connecting to a Fluid service.
-   Fluid Framework [developer tools](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/tree/main/packages/tools/devtools/devtools).
-   `@fluidframework/app-insights-logger`: to route Fluid telemetry to Azure App Insights.

## Using Fluid Framework libraries

When taking a dependency on a Fluid Framework library, we recommend using a `^` (caret) version range, such as `^1.3.4`.
While Fluid Framework libraries may use different ranges with interdependencies between other Fluid Framework libraries,
library consumers should always prefer `^`.

## Importing from this package

This package leverages [package.json exports](https://nodejs.org/api/packages.html#exports) to separate its APIs by support level.
For more information on the related support guarantees, see [API Support Levels](https://fluidframework.com/docs/build/releases-and-apitags/#api-support-levels).

To access the `public` ([SemVer](https://semver.org/)) APIs, import via `fluid-framework` like normal.

To access the `legacy` APIs, import via `fluid-framework/legacy`.

## Contents

The `fluid-framework` package consists primarily of two portions: the `IFluidContainer` and a selection of distributed data structures (DDSes).

### IFluidContainer

The **[IFluidContainer][]** interface is one of the types returned by calls to `createContainer()` and `getContainer()` on the service clients such as `AzureClient`.
It includes functionality to retrieve the Fluid data contained within, as well as to inspect the state of the collaboration session connection.

### DDS packages

You'll use one or more DDS data structures in your container to model your collaborative data.
The `fluid-framework` package offers the following data structures:

1. **[SharedTree][]**
1. **[SharedMap][]**, a map-like data structure for storing key/value pair data
    - Note: as of version 2.0, `SharedMap` is now marked legacy. Please use `SharedTree` for any new development.

## Tutorial

Check out the [Hello World tutorial](https://fluidframework.com/docs/start/tutorial/) using `fluid-framework`.
