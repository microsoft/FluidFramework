    /**
     * Following are the goals of this function.
     *  a.) Converts the summary tree to a snapshot/odsp tree to be uploaded. Always upload full snapshot tree.
     *  b.) Blob deduping - Blob deduping means instead of creating a new blob on server we reuse a previous
     *      blob which has same content as the blob being evaluated. In this case we send the server a path
     *      of the previous blob as id so that server can refer to that blob and find out the actual contents
     *      of the blob. We always send the path from the last uploaded summary as we always upload the full
     *      snapshot tree instead of handles.
     *      Handles: Whenever we evaluate a handle in current summary, we expect that a summary tree corresponding
     *               to that handle exists in "treesPathToTree" cache. We get that tree and start evaluating it.
     *               This leads us to dedup any blobs which could be deduped but wasn't because we can't refer to blobs
     *               within same summary due to limitation of server. We set the "expanded" as true in that case.
     *      Blobs: For a blob, we find the hash of the blobs using the contents so that we can match with the ones in
     *             caches and if present we dedup them. Now when the expanded is true we always expect it to be present
     *             in the cache because it means that it was also present in the last summary. So while expanding a handle
     *             we make sure that we are not adding a new blob instead we are just deduping the ones which can be deduped.
     *             If not expanding a handle, we still check whether the blob can de deduped. If so, we use the cachedPath
     *             as id of the blob so that the server can refer to it.
     *  c.) Building new trees/blobs dedup caches so that they can be used to dedup blobs in next summary.
     * @param parentHandle - Handle of the last uploaded summary or detach new summary.
     * @param tree - Summary Tree which will be converted to snapshot tree to be uploaded.
     * @param blobTreeDedupCachesLatest - Blobs/Trees caches which will be build to be used in next summary upload
     *  in order to dedup the blobs.
     * @param rootNodeName - Root node name of the summary tree.
     * @param path - Current path of node which is getting evaluated.
     * @param expanded - True if we are currently expanding a handle by a tree stored in the cache.
