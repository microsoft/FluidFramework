# @fluidframework/odsp-driver

The ODSP (OneDrive/Sharepoint) driver is an implementation of a Fluid driver that facilitate communication between
the client and the ODSP server to retrieve Fluid content and connect to the Fluid collaboration session.

The ODSP Fluid service is not a publicly available service, and currently it is not possible to use this driver
to connect to it. This driver is present as an illustration of a different Fluid driver implementation.
Developers should not depend on this driver for their own solutions.

## Using Fluid Framework libraries

When taking a dependency on a Fluid Framework library's public APIs, we recommend using a `^` (caret) version range, such as `^1.3.4`.
While Fluid Framework libraries may use different ranges with interdependencies between other Fluid Framework libraries,
library consumers should always prefer `^`.

If using any of Fluid Framework's unstable APIs (for example, its `beta` APIs), we recommend using a more constrained version range, such as `~`.

## Installation

To get started, install the package by running the following command:

```bash
npm i @fluidframework/odsp-driver
```

## Importing from this package

This package leverages [package.json exports](https://nodejs.org/api/packages.html#exports) to separate its APIs by support level.
For more information on the related support guarantees, see [API Support Levels](https://fluidframework.com/docs/build/releases-and-apitags/#api-support-levels).

To access the `public` ([SemVer](https://semver.org/)) APIs, import via `@fluidframework/odsp-driver` like normal.

To access the `legacy` APIs, import via `@fluidframework/odsp-driver/legacy`.

## API Documentation

## ODSP APIs

Documenting some basics about opds-driver specific apis that are relevant for creation or loading of a Fluid file from ODSP.

### /snapshot API

-   Creates a new Fluid file with the contents as the summary provided in the request body.
-   The creation of file along with the summary is done in a single api call to reduce the number of round trips during new file creation.
-   Also supports creation of sharing link for the file if appropriate request headers are provided in the api call. This feature was introduced to save the number of round trips that a host app makes while creating a file and then creating a sharing link.
    1.  Earlier only `&createLinkType=csl` parameter was supported which could create organizational scoped sharing links. Feature is gated by `enableShareLinkWithCreate` provided via `HostStoragePolicy`. (createLinkType is now deprecated, so prefer using option 2 below)
    1.  Now, providing appropriate values for `&createLinkScope` and `&createLinkRole` request parameters will let you create sharing links with various permission scopes. See `resolvedUrl` definition for more details. Feature is gated by `enableSingleRequestForShareLinkWithCreate ` provided via `HostStoragePolicy`.

### /trees/latest API

-   Fetches the snapshot of an existing Fluid file.
-   Earlier, application needed to redeem the sharing link of the file before a /trees/latest fetch could be made. To reduce the number of round trips made to ODSP, redemption of the share link now happens along with fetching latest snapshot in the same api request by passing share link in `&sl` request parameter.
-   This api is also preflight-less, which means it is not preceded by an OPTIONS call in the browsers to reduce the network trips to the server.

## Minimum Client Requirements

These are the platform requirements for the current version of Fluid Framework Client Packages.
These requirements err on the side of being too strict since within a major version they can be relaxed over time, but not made stricter.
For Long Term Support (LTS) versions this can require supporting these platforms for several years.

It is likely that other configurations will work, but they are not supported: if they stop working, we do not consider that a bug.
If you would benefit from support for something not listed here, file an issue and the product team will evaluate your request.
When making such a request please include if the configuration already works (and thus the request is just that it becomes officially supported), or if changes are required to get it working.

### Supported Runtimes

-   NodeJs ^20.10.0 except that we will drop support for it [when NodeJs 20 loses its upstream support on 2026-04-30](https://github.com/nodejs/release#release-schedule), and will support a newer LTS version of NodeJS (22) at least 1 year before 20 is end-of-life. This same policy applies to NodeJS 22 when it is end of life (2027-04-30).
-   Running Fluid in a Node.js environment with the `--no-experimental-fetch` flag is no longer supported.
-   Modern browsers supporting the es2022 standard library: in response to asks we can add explicit support for using babel to polyfill to target specific standards or runtimes (meaning we can avoid/remove use of things that don't polyfill robustly, but otherwise target modern standards).

### Supported Tools

-   TypeScript 5.4:
    -   All [`strict`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig) options are supported.
    -   [`strictNullChecks`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig) is required.
    -   [Configuration options deprecated in 5.0](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/51909) are not supported.
    -   `exactOptionalPropertyTypes` is currently not fully supported.
        If used, narrowing members of Fluid Framework types types using `in`, `Reflect.has`, `Object.hasOwn` or `Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty` should be avoided as they may incorrectly exclude `undefined` from the possible values in some cases.
-   [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) 5
    -   We are not intending to be prescriptive about what bundler to use.
        Other bundlers which can handle ES Modules should work, but webpack is the only one we actively test.

### Module Resolution

[`Node16`, `NodeNext`, or `Bundler`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#moduleResolution) resolution should be used with TypeScript compilerOptions to follow the [Node.js v12+ ESM Resolution and Loading algorithm](https://nodejs.github.io/nodejs.dev/en/api/v20/esm/#resolution-and-loading-algorithm).
Node10 resolution is not supported as it does not support Fluid Framework's API structuring pattern that is used to distinguish stable APIs from those that are in development.

### Module Formats

-   ES Modules:
    ES Modules are the preferred way to consume our client packages (including in NodeJs) and consuming our client packages from ES Modules is fully supported.
-   CommonJs:
    Consuming our client packages as CommonJs is supported only in NodeJS and only for the cases listed below.
    This is done to accommodate some workflows without good ES Module support.
    If you have a workflow you would like included in this list, file an issue.
    Once this list of workflows motivating CommonJS support is empty, we may drop support for CommonJS one year after notice of the change is posted here.

    -   Testing with Jest (which lacks [stable ESM support](https://jestjs.io/docs/ecmascript-modules) due to [unstable APIs in NodeJs](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/37648))
