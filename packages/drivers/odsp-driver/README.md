# @fluidframework/odsp-driver

The ODSP (OneDrive/Sharepoint) driver is an implementation of a Fluid driver that facilitate communication between
the client and the ODSP server to retrieve Fluid content and connect to the Fluid collaboration session.

The ODSP Fluid service is not a publicly available service, and currently it is not possible to use this driver
to connect to it. This driver is present as an illustration of a different Fluid driver implementation.
Developers should not depend on this driver for their own solutions.
