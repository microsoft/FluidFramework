		// There are two ways to accomplish it:
		// 1. Leave it as is at socket.io level - it can transfer mixes (JS + binary) messages just fine. On service side,
		//    likely would need to serialize it into binary blob and pass around binary. Maybe doing encodeJsonableOrBinary
		//    on service side is fine (saves bandwidth as we do not waste +33% overhead of base64 encoding), but this makes
		//    service side less efficient (compared if service does some more efficient binary serialization)
		// 2. Serialize into binary here (in driver), and deserialize back on receiving signals, but service and socket.io
		//    works only with binary payloads. Likely most efficient, as avoids extra serialization - deserialization at
		//    socket.io level.
		// The only reason it works as is - ConnectionManager will do decodeJsonableOrBinary() if it gets a string payload.
		// But this is wrong, as we should not have any assumptions going across layers on what kind of serialization format
		// is used - both serialization / deserialization should happen on one layer! (it's Ok to temporarily break this rule
		//  for staging purpose only)
