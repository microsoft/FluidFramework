/**
 * This tool cleans up a message.json file downloaded through fluid-fetch to remove
 * user content and user identifying information.  Enough information can be retained
 * to allow loading through Fluid Preview, or everything can be scrubbed so that only
 * replay-tool can read the result.  Anonymous identifying information such as client
 * IDs are always retained.  Object keys are NOT scrubbed, including those that are
 * nested within values (only leaf values are scrubbed).
 *
 * Note: While user content/information is scrubbed, it should not be assumed to be
 * fully anonymized because certain meta-information (such as word lengths and
 * consistent replacement) are preserved.
 *
 * Messages must match known structures when scrubbing for Fluid Preview.
