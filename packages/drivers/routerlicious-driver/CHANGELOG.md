    Update package implementations to use TypeScript 5.4.5.

-   Update to ES 2022 ([#21292](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/pull/21292)) [68921502f7](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/68921502f79b1833c4cd6d0fe339bfb126a712c7)

    Update tsconfig to target ES 2022.

## 2.0.0-rc.4.0.0

Dependency updates only.

## 2.0.0-rc.3.0.0

### Major Changes

-   Packages now use package.json "exports" and require modern module resolution [97d68aa06b](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/97d68aa06bd5c022ecb026655814aea222a062ae)

    Fluid Framework packages have been updated to use the [package.json "exports"
    field](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v18.x/api/packages.html#exports) to define explicit entry points for both
    TypeScript types and implementation code.

    This means that using Fluid Framework packages require the following TypeScript settings in tsconfig.json:

    -   `"moduleResolution": "Node16"` with `"module": "Node16"`
    -   `"moduleResolution": "Bundler"` with `"module": "ESNext"`

    We recommend using Node16/Node16 unless absolutely necessary. That will produce transpiled JavaScript that is suitable
    for use with modern versions of Node.js _and_ Bundlers.
    [See the TypeScript documentation](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#moduleResolution) for more information
    regarding the module and moduleResolution options.

    **Node10 moduleResolution is not supported; it does not support Fluid Framework's API structuring pattern that is used
    to distinguish stable APIs from those that are in development.**

## 2.0.0-rc.2.0.0

### Minor Changes

-   Resolved URLs no longer use non-standard protocols ([#19840](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/issues/19840)) [9d3d185183](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/9d3d1851830d953792a6dfad60dde6f1c59480de)

    Previously, `IResolvedUrl.url` could use a non-standard protocol like `fluid://`, `fluid-odsp://`, or `fluid-test://`. These have been replaced with `https://` to permit standards-compliant URL parsing.

-   driver-definitions: repositoryUrl removed from IDocumentStorageService ([#19522](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/issues/19522)) [90eb3c9d33](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/90eb3c9d33d80e24caa1393a50f414c5602f6aa3)

    The `repositoryUrl` member of `IDocumentStorageService` was unused and always equal to the empty string. It has been removed.

-   Deprecated error-related enums have been removed ([#19067](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/issues/19067)) [59793302e5](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/59793302e56784cfb6ace0e6469345f3565b3312)

    Error-related enums `ContainerErrorType`, `DriverErrorType`, `OdspErrorType` and `RouterliciousErrorType` were previously
    deprecated and are now removed. There are replacement object-based enumerations of `ContainerErrorTypes`,
    `DriverErrorTypes`, `OdspErrorTypes` and `RouterliciousErrorTypes`. Refer to the release notes of [Fluid Framework version
    2.0.0-internal.7.0.0](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/releases/tag/client_v2.0.0-internal.7.0.0) for details
    on the replacements.

-   routerlicious-driver: Ephemeral containers now controlled in attach() call rather than as driver policy ([#19646](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/issues/19646)) [22bd1fc045](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/22bd1fc045fd6bb74eed812ddcf86ae85bd81125)

    Previously, ephemeral containers were created by adding an `isEphemeralContainer` flag in `IRouterliciousDriverPolicies`. Now, it is controlled by a `createAsEphemeral` flag on the resolved URL. See <https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/pull/19544> for an example of how to set this flag via your URL resolver.

-   container-definitions: Added containerMetadata prop on IContainer interface ([#19142](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/issues/19142)) [d0d77f3516](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/d0d77f3516d67f3c9faedb47b20dbd4e309c3bc2)

    Added `containerMetadata` prop on IContainer interface.

-   runtime-definitions: Moved ISignalEnvelope interface to core-interfaces ([#19142](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/issues/19142)) [d0d77f3516](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/d0d77f3516d67f3c9faedb47b20dbd4e309c3bc2)

    The `ISignalEnvelope` interface has been moved to the @fluidframework/core-interfaces package.

### Major Changes

-   Dependencies on @fluidframework/protocol-definitions package updated to 3.0.0 [871b3493dd](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/871b3493dd0d7ea3a89be64998ceb6cb9021a04e)

    This included the following changes from the protocol-definitions release:

    -   Updating signal interfaces for some planned improvements. The intention is split the interface between signals
        submitted by clients to the server and the resulting signals sent from the server to clients.
        -   A new optional type member is available on the ISignalMessage interface and a new ISentSignalMessage interface has
            been added, which will be the typing for signals sent from the client to the server. Both extend a new
            ISignalMessageBase interface that contains common members.
    -   The @fluidframework/common-definitions package dependency has been updated to version 1.0.0.

-   routerlicious-driver: remove dead blob aggregation concepts and code [871b3493dd](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/871b3493dd0d7ea3a89be64998ceb6cb9021a04e)

    Dead concepts blob aggregation like `aggregateBlobsSmallerThanBytes` and `minBlobSize` have been removed.

### Major Changes

-   Server compatibility change: Upload first summary as base64 blob [8abce8cdb4](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/8abce8cdb4e2832fb6405fb44e393bef03d5648a)

    We are updating the client to adjust the behavior of the routerlicious driver during the first summary, which will now allow non-UTF-8 compatible binaries to be submitted. (See [PR #16286](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/pull/16286) and [PR #16397](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/pull/16397)). To support this change, it is necessary for the servers to run the latest versions that are prepared to work with this new format.

    This means that this version of routerlicious-driver requires routerlicious server version >=1.0.0.

    When uploading summaries, the SummaryTreeUploadManager and WholeSummaryUploadManager currently use different conversion types based on the content of the ISummaryTree object. If the content is binary, the encoding is base64, and if it comes from a string, the encoding is utf-8. Previously, there was an exception for the first summary, which was always encoded in utf-8. However, recent changes have adjusted the server code to replicate this processing for all summaries. As a result, new clients will need to be run against recent versions of the servers that understand this new format.

-   Upgraded typescript transpilation target to ES2020 [8abce8cdb4](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/8abce8cdb4e2832fb6405fb44e393bef03d5648a)

    Upgraded typescript transpilation target to ES2020. This is done in order to decrease the bundle sizes of Fluid Framework packages. This has provided size improvements across the board for ex. Loader, Driver, Runtime etc. Reduced bundle sizes helps to load lesser code in apps and hence also helps to improve the perf.If any app wants to target any older versions of browsers with which this target version is not compatible, then they can use packages like babel to transpile to a older target.
