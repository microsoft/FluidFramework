/**
 * This test suite is a prototype for a multi-process end to end test for Fluid using the new Presence API on AzureClient.
 * In the future we hope to expand and generalize this pattern to broadly test more Fluid features.
 * Currently our E2E tests are limited to running multiple clients on a single process which does not effectively
 * simulate real-world production scenarios where clients are usually running on different machines.
 *
 * The pattern demonstrated in this test suite is as follows:
 *
 * This main test file acts as the 'Orchestrator'. The orchestrator's job includes:
 * - Fork child processes to simulate multiple Fluid clients
 * - Send command messages to child clients to perform specific Fluid actions.
 * - Receive response messages from child clients to verify expected behavior.
 * - Clean up child processes after each test.
 *
 * The child processes are located in the `childClient.ts` file. Each child process simulates a Fluid client.
 *
 * The child client's job includes:
 * - Create/Get + connect to Fluid container.
 * - Listen for command messages from the orchestrator.
 * - Perform the requested action.
 * - Send response messages including any relevant data back to the orchestrator to verify expected behavior.
 *
 * This particular test suite tests the following E2E functionality for Presence:
 * - Announce 'attendeeJoined' when remote client joins session.
 * - Announce 'attendeeDisconnected' when remote client disconnects.
