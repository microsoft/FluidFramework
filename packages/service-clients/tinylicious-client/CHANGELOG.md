    The following Fluid server dependencies have been updated to the latest version, 5.0.0. [See the full changelog.](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/blob/main/server/routerlicious/RELEASE_NOTES/5.0.0.md)

    -   @fluidframework/gitresources
    -   @fluidframework/server-kafka-orderer
    -   @fluidframework/server-lambdas
    -   @fluidframework/server-lambdas-driver
    -   @fluidframework/server-local-server
    -   @fluidframework/server-memory-orderer
    -   @fluidframework/protocol-base
    -   @fluidframework/server-routerlicious
    -   @fluidframework/server-routerlicious-base
    -   @fluidframework/server-services
    -   @fluidframework/server-services-client
    -   @fluidframework/server-services-core
    -   @fluidframework/server-services-ordering-kafkanode
    -   @fluidframework/server-services-ordering-rdkafka
    -   @fluidframework/server-services-ordering-zookeeper
    -   @fluidframework/server-services-shared
    -   @fluidframework/server-services-telemetry
    -   @fluidframework/server-services-utils
    -   @fluidframework/server-test-utils
    -   tinylicious

-   Update to TypeScript 5.4 ([#21214](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/pull/21214)) [0e6256c722](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/0e6256c722d8bf024f4325bf02547daeeb18bfa6)

    Update package implementations to use TypeScript 5.4.5.

-   azure-client, tinylicious-client: compatibilityMode parameter added to createContainer and getContainer on AzureClient and TinyliciousClient ([#20997](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/pull/20997)) [2730787209](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/2730787209a60155752d51da3c78cf97e1b5f3f9)

    To support migration from 1.x to 2.0, a compatibility mode parameter has been added to these methods on AzureClient and TinyliciousClient. When set to "1", this allows interop between the 2.0 clients and 1.x clients. When set to "2", interop with 1.x clients is disallowed but new 2.0 features may be used.

-   tinylicious-client: Types are now beta ([#21386](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/pull/21386)) [0511e59860](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/0511e598600464cb0e6bddd7dc064a01cec131ed)

    `TinyliciousClient` and related types have been promoted to `@beta`.

## 2.0.0-rc.4.0.0

### Minor Changes

-   Rename `AzureMember.userName` to `AzureMember.name` and `IMember.userId` to `IMember.id` [96872186d0](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/96872186d0d0f245c1fece7d19b3743e501679b6)

    1. Renamed `AzureMember.userName` to `AzureMember.name` to establish uniform naming across odsp-client and azure-client.
    2. Renamed `IMember.userId` to `IMember.id` to align with the properties received from AFR.

## 2.0.0-rc.3.0.0

### Major Changes

-   Packages now use package.json "exports" and require modern module resolution [97d68aa06b](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/97d68aa06bd5c022ecb026655814aea222a062ae)

    Fluid Framework packages have been updated to use the [package.json "exports"
    field](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v18.x/api/packages.html#exports) to define explicit entry points for both
    TypeScript types and implementation code.

    This means that using Fluid Framework packages require the following TypeScript settings in tsconfig.json:

    -   `"moduleResolution": "Node16"` with `"module": "Node16"`
    -   `"moduleResolution": "Bundler"` with `"module": "ESNext"`

    We recommend using Node16/Node16 unless absolutely necessary. That will produce transpiled JavaScript that is suitable
    for use with modern versions of Node.js _and_ Bundlers.
    [See the TypeScript documentation](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#moduleResolution) for more information
    regarding the module and moduleResolution options.

    **Node10 moduleResolution is not supported; it does not support Fluid Framework's API structuring pattern that is used
    to distinguish stable APIs from those that are in development.**

## 2.0.0-rc.2.0.0

### Minor Changes

-   Deprecated error-related enums have been removed ([#19067](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/issues/19067)) [59793302e5](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/59793302e56784cfb6ace0e6469345f3565b3312)

    Error-related enums `ContainerErrorType`, `DriverErrorType`, `OdspErrorType` and `RouterliciousErrorType` were previously
    deprecated and are now removed. There are replacement object-based enumerations of `ContainerErrorTypes`,
    `DriverErrorTypes`, `OdspErrorTypes` and `RouterliciousErrorTypes`. Refer to the release notes of [Fluid Framework version
    2.0.0-internal.7.0.0](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/releases/tag/client_v2.0.0-internal.7.0.0) for details
    on the replacements.

## 2.0.0-rc.1.0.0

### Minor Changes

-   Updated server dependencies ([#19122](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/issues/19122)) [25366b4229](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/25366b422918cb43685c5f328b50450749592902)

    The following Fluid server dependencies have been updated to the latest version, 3.0.0. [See the full changelog.](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/releases/tag/server_v3.0.0)

    -   @fluidframework/gitresources
    -   @fluidframework/server-kafka-orderer
    -   @fluidframework/server-lambdas
    -   @fluidframework/server-lambdas-driver
    -   @fluidframework/server-local-server
    -   @fluidframework/server-memory-orderer
    -   @fluidframework/protocol-base

    -   @fluidframework/server-routerlicious-base
    -   @fluidframework/server-services
    -   @fluidframework/server-services-client
    -   @fluidframework/server-services-core

    -   @fluidframework/server-services-telemetry
    -   @fluidframework/server-services-utils
    -   @fluidframework/server-test-utils
    -   tinylicious

-   Updated @fluidframework/protocol-definitions ([#19122](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/issues/19122)) [25366b4229](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/25366b422918cb43685c5f328b50450749592902)

    The @fluidframework/protocol-definitions dependency has been upgraded to v3.1.0. [See the full
    changelog.](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/blob/main/common/lib/protocol-definitions/CHANGELOG.md#310)

## 2.0.0-internal.8.0.0

### Major Changes

-   azure-client: Removed deprecated FluidStatic classes [9a451d4946](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/9a451d4946b5c51a52e4d1ab5bf51e7b285b0d74)

    Several FluidStatic classes were unnecessarily exposed and were deprecated in an earlier release. They have been replaced with creation functions. This helps us
    keep implementations decoupled from usage which is easier to maintain and extend. It has very minimal impact on the
    public surface area of downstream packages. The removed classes are as follows:

    -   `AzureAudience` (use `IAzureAudience` instead)
    -   `TinyliciousAudience` (use `ITinyliciousAudience` instead)
    -   `DOProviderContainerRuntimeFactory`
    -   `FluidContainer`
    -   `ServiceAudience`

### Major Changes

-   Dependencies on @fluidframework/protocol-definitions package updated to 3.0.0 [871b3493dd](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/871b3493dd0d7ea3a89be64998ceb6cb9021a04e)

    This included the following changes from the protocol-definitions release:

    -   Updating signal interfaces for some planned improvements. The intention is split the interface between signals
        submitted by clients to the server and the resulting signals sent from the server to clients.
        -   A new optional type member is available on the ISignalMessage interface and a new ISentSignalMessage interface has
            been added, which will be the typing for signals sent from the client to the server. Both extend a new
            ISignalMessageBase interface that contains common members.
    -   The @fluidframework/common-definitions package dependency has been updated to version 1.0.0.

-   Server upgrade: dependencies on Fluid server packages updated to 2.0.1 [871b3493dd](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/871b3493dd0d7ea3a89be64998ceb6cb9021a04e)

### Major Changes

-   Upgraded typescript transpilation target to ES2020 [8abce8cdb4](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/8abce8cdb4e2832fb6405fb44e393bef03d5648a)

    Upgraded typescript transpilation target to ES2020. This is done in order to decrease the bundle sizes of Fluid Framework packages. This has provided size improvements across the board for ex. Loader, Driver, Runtime etc. Reduced bundle sizes helps to load lesser code in apps and hence also helps to improve the perf.If any app wants to target any older versions of browsers with which this target version is not compatible, then they can use packages like babel to transpile to a older target.
