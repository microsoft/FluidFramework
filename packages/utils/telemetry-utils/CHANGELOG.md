# @fluidframework/telemetry-utils

## 2.0.0-rc.5.0.0

### Major Changes

-   telemetry-utils: BREAKING CHANGE: Update MockLogger's events property is no longer externally mutable ([#21470](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/pull/21470)) [a9cc448107](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/a9cc44810707d58f64350d468a922ed0a307ede9)

    If you depended on this mutability to implement some behavior, you should create your own mock logger implementation.

    If you depended on this mutability to work around the logger's self-clearing behavior after running a match check, you
    can now override this behavior via the `clearEventsAfterCheck` parameter.

### Minor Changes

-   Update to TypeScript 5.4 ([#21214](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/pull/21214)) [0e6256c722](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/0e6256c722d8bf024f4325bf02547daeeb18bfa6)

    Update package implementations to use TypeScript 5.4.5.

-   Update to ES 2022 ([#21292](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/pull/21292)) [68921502f7](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/68921502f79b1833c4cd6d0fe339bfb126a712c7)

    Update tsconfig to target ES 2022.

-   telemetry-utils: Deprecate `MockLogger` for external use. ([#21497](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/pull/21497)) [ed09fac561](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/ed09fac5617ef832b2febfd3427a2949f8777bfe)

    No replacement API is given. This type was never intended for use outside of the `fluid-framework` repository.
    If you were depending on this class for testing purposes, we recommend creating your own mock logger implementation,
    or copy and adapt the code from `fluid-framework` as needed.

## 2.0.0-rc.4.0.0

### Major Changes

-   telemetry-utils: Internal telemetry types removed from public API surface [96872186d0](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/96872186d0d0f245c1fece7d19b3743e501679b6)

    We have updated the tags for the following telemetry-related types in the FluidFramework: TelemetryEventCategory, TelemetryEventPropertyTypeExt, ITelemetryPropertiesExt, ITelemetryGenericEventExt, ITelemetryErrorEventExt, ITelemetryPerformanceEventExt, ITelemetryLoggerExt. For developers using any of these types, the primary action required is to transition to using the corresponding "base" type. For example, replace ITelemetryPerformanceEventExt with ITelemetryBaseEvent from @core-interfaces.

## 2.0.0-rc.3.0.0

### Major Changes

-   Packages now use package.json "exports" and require modern module resolution [97d68aa06b](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/97d68aa06bd5c022ecb026655814aea222a062ae)

    Fluid Framework packages have been updated to use the [package.json "exports"
    field](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v18.x/api/packages.html#exports) to define explicit entry points for both
    TypeScript types and implementation code.

    This means that using Fluid Framework packages require the following TypeScript settings in tsconfig.json:

    -   `"moduleResolution": "Node16"` with `"module": "Node16"`
    -   `"moduleResolution": "Bundler"` with `"module": "ESNext"`

    We recommend using Node16/Node16 unless absolutely necessary. That will produce transpiled JavaScript that is suitable
    for use with modern versions of Node.js _and_ Bundlers.
    [See the TypeScript documentation](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#moduleResolution) for more information
    regarding the module and moduleResolution options.

    **Node10 moduleResolution is not supported; it does not support Fluid Framework's API structuring pattern that is used
    to distinguish stable APIs from those that are in development.**

## 2.0.0-rc.2.0.0

### Minor Changes

-   fluid-framework: EventEmitterWithErrorHandling is no longer publicly exported ([#19717](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/issues/19717)) [ae1d0be26d](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/ae1d0be26d61453cff316b3f622a9f3647149167)

    EventEmitterWithErrorHandling is intended for authoring DDSes, and thus is only intended for use within the Fluid Framework client packages.
    It is no longer publicly exported: any users should fine their own solution or be upstreamed.
    EventEmitterWithErrorHandling is available for now as `@alpha` to make this migration less disrupting for any existing users.

-   telemetry-utils: logIfFalse() is removed ([#19597](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/issues/19597)) [213b5ab761](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/213b5ab7611c214fda7fa005f89ac37c2f1695c1)

    The deprecated `logIfFalse()` function has been removed. Consumers who want to keep using it can reimplement in in their
    codebase by copying it from a previous version of the `@fluidframework/telemetry-utils` package.

-   Deprecated error-related enums have been removed ([#19067](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/issues/19067)) [59793302e5](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/59793302e56784cfb6ace0e6469345f3565b3312)

    Error-related enums `ContainerErrorType`, `DriverErrorType`, `OdspErrorType` and `RouterliciousErrorType` were previously
    deprecated and are now removed. There are replacement object-based enumerations of `ContainerErrorTypes`,
    `DriverErrorTypes`, `OdspErrorTypes` and `RouterliciousErrorTypes`. Refer to the release notes of [Fluid Framework version
    2.0.0-internal.7.0.0](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/releases/tag/client_v2.0.0-internal.7.0.0) for details
    on the replacements.

## 2.0.0-rc.1.0.0

### Minor Changes

-   Updated server dependencies ([#19122](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/issues/19122)) [25366b4229](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/25366b422918cb43685c5f328b50450749592902)

    The @fluidframework/protocol-definitions dependency has been upgraded to v3.1.0. [See the full
    changelog.](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/blob/main/common/lib/protocol-definitions/CHANGELOG.md#310)

-   Remove deprecated config types from telemetry-utils ([#18839](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/issues/18839)) [42f17a267c](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/42f17a267cf796e262da08395cf9fc3cede4bce5)

    The types `ConfigTypes` and `IConfigProviderBase` were deprecated and are now removed from @fluidframework/telemetry-utils. They continue to exist in @fluidframework/core-interfaces. Please update your reference to use these types from @fluidframework/core-interfaces.

## 2.0.0-internal.8.0.0

Dependency updates only.

## 2.0.0-internal.7.4.0

### Minor Changes

-   telemetry-utils: Deprecate ConfigTypes and IConfigProviderBase ([#18597](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/issues/18597)) [39b9ff57c0](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/39b9ff57c0184b72f0e3f9425922dda944995265)

    The types `ConfigTypes` and `IConfigProviderBase` have been deprecated in the @fluidframework/telemetry-utils package.
    The types can now be found in the @fluidframework/core-interfaces package. Please replace any uses with the types from
    @fluidframework/core-interfaces.

-   telemetry-utils: Deprecated logIfFalse ([#18047](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/issues/18047)) [57614ffdc6](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/57614ffdc6e3fbd22ddbe5ed589c75d3d195aa48)

    This functionality was not intended for export and will be removed in a future release.
    No replacement API is offered because the logic is trivial to reproduce as needed.

### Major Changes

-   Dependencies on @fluidframework/protocol-definitions package updated to 3.0.0 [871b3493dd](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/871b3493dd0d7ea3a89be64998ceb6cb9021a04e)

    This included the following changes from the protocol-definitions release:

    -   Updating signal interfaces for some planned improvements. The intention is split the interface between signals
        submitted by clients to the server and the resulting signals sent from the server to clients.
        -   A new optional type member is available on the ISignalMessage interface and a new ISentSignalMessage interface has
            been added, which will be the typing for signals sent from the client to the server. Both extend a new
            ISignalMessageBase interface that contains common members.
    -   The @fluidframework/common-definitions package dependency has been updated to version 1.0.0.

    The minimum supported TypeScript version for Fluid 2.0 clients is now 5.1.6.

-   @fluidframework/container-utils package removed [871b3493dd](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/871b3493dd0d7ea3a89be64998ceb6cb9021a04e)

    All members of the **@fluidframework/container-utils** package have been deprecated and the package is now removed.

    Migration by API member:

    -   `ClientSessionExpiredError` (deprecated in `2.0.0-internal.6.2.0`): No replacement API offered.
    -   `DataCorruptionError` (deprecated in `2.0.0-internal.6.2.0`): Import from [@fluidframework/telemetry-utils](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@fluidframework/telemetry-utils) instead.
    -   `DataProcessingError` (deprecated in `2.0.0-internal.6.2.0`): Import from [@fluidframework/telemetry-utils](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@fluidframework/telemetry-utils) instead.

## 2.0.0-internal.6.4.0

### Minor Changes

-   Upcoming: The type of the logger property/param in various APIs will be changing ([#17350](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/issues/17350)) [27284bcda3](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/27284bcda3d63cc4306cf76806f8a075db0db60f)

    -   @fluidframework/runtime-definitions
        -   `IFluidDataStoreRuntime.logger` will be re-typed as `ITelemetryBaseLogger`
    -   @fluidframework/odsp-driver
        -   `protected OdspDocumentServiceFactoryCore.createDocumentServiceCore`'s parameter `odspLogger` will be re-typed as `ITelemetryLoggerExt`
        -   `protected LocalOdspDocumentServiceFactory.createDocumentServiceCore`'s parameter `odspLogger` will be re-typed as `ITelemetryLoggerExt`

    Additionally, several of @fluidframework/telemetry-utils's exports are being marked as internal and should not be consumed outside of other FF packages.

## 2.0.0-internal.6.3.0

### Minor Changes

-   Cleaning up duplicate or misnamed telemetry types ([#17149](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/issues/17149)) [f9236942fa](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/f9236942faf03cde860bfcbc7c28f8fbd81d3868)

    We have two sets of telemetry-related interfaces:

    -   The "Base" ones
        -   These have a very bare API surface
        -   They are used on public API surfaces to transmit logs across layers
    -   The internal ones
        -   These have a richer API surface (multiple log functions with different categories,
            support for logging flat arrays and objects)
        -   They are used for instrumenting our code, and then normalize and pass off the logs via the Base interface

    There are two problems with the given state of the world:

    1. The "Base" ones were not named consistently, so the distinction was not as apparent as it could be
    2. The internal ones were copied to `@fluidframework/telemetry-utils` and futher extended, but the original duplicates remain.

    This change addresses these by adding "Base" to the name of each base type, and deprecating the old duplicate internal types.

    Additionally, the following types were adjusted:

    -   `TelemetryEventCategory` is moving from `@fluidframework/core-interfaces` to `@fluidframework/telemetry-utils`
    -   Several types modeling "tagged" telemetry properties are deprecated in favor of a generic type `Tagged<V>`

## 2.0.0-internal.6.2.0

### Minor Changes

-   Remove use of @fluidframework/common-definitions ([#16638](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/issues/16638)) [a8c81509c9](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/a8c81509c9bf09cfb2092ebcf7265205f9eb6dbf)

    The **@fluidframework/common-definitions** package is being deprecated, so the following interfaces and types are now
    imported from the **@fluidframework/core-interfaces** package:

    -   interface IDisposable
    -   interface IErrorEvent
    -   interface IErrorEvent
    -   interface IEvent
    -   interface IEventProvider
    -   interface ILoggingError
    -   interface ITaggedTelemetryPropertyType
    -   interface ITelemetryBaseEvent
    -   interface ITelemetryBaseLogger
    -   interface ITelemetryErrorEvent
    -   interface ITelemetryGenericEvent
    -   interface ITelemetryLogger
    -   interface ITelemetryPerformanceEvent
    -   interface ITelemetryProperties
    -   type ExtendEventProvider
    -   type IEventThisPlaceHolder
    -   type IEventTransformer
    -   type ReplaceIEventThisPlaceHolder
    -   type ReplaceIEventThisPlaceHolder
    -   type TelemetryEventCategory
    -   type TelemetryEventPropertyType

## 2.0.0-internal.6.1.0

### Minor Changes

-   Removed `TelemetryNullLogger` class is again exported from @fluidframework/telemetry-utils ([#16841](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/issues/16841)) [697f46a838](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/697f46a838706a046c402ba96624b8f07ebc3b07)

    The `TelemetryNullLogger` class has been brought back to ease the transition to `2.0.0-internal.6.x`
    _but is still deprecated_ and will be removed in `2.0.0-internal.7.0.0`.

    For internal use within the FluidFramework codebase, use `createChildLogger()` with no arguments instead.
    For external consumers we recommend writing a trivial implementation of `ITelemetryBaseLogger`
    (from the `@fluidframework/core-interfaces` package) where the `send()` method does nothing and using that.

## 2.0.0-internal.6.0.0

### Major Changes

-   Remove Deprecated Loggers [8abce8cdb4](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/8abce8cdb4e2832fb6405fb44e393bef03d5648a)

    This change removes the previously deprecated logger implementations. The following replacements are available:

    -   replace ChildLogger.create, new TelemetryNullLogger, and new BaseTelemetryNullLogger with createChildLogger
    -   replace new MultiSinkLogger with createMultiSinkLogger
    -   replace TelemetryUTLogger with MockLogger
    -   DebugLogger has no intended replacement

-   MockLogger is no longer a TelemetryLogger [8abce8cdb4](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/8abce8cdb4e2832fb6405fb44e393bef03d5648a)

    TelemetryLogger was deprecated and has now been removed, so MockLogger can no longer inherit from it. MockLogger is now a ITelemetryBaseLogger, to get an ITelemetryLogger, or ITelemetryLoggerExt there is a new convenience method, `MockLogger.toTelemetryLogger()`

-   Upgraded typescript transpilation target to ES2020 [8abce8cdb4](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/8abce8cdb4e2832fb6405fb44e393bef03d5648a)

    Upgraded typescript transpilation target to ES2020. This is done in order to decrease the bundle sizes of Fluid Framework packages. This has provided size improvements across the board for ex. Loader, Driver, Runtime etc. Reduced bundle sizes helps to load lesser code in apps and hence also helps to improve the perf.If any app wants to target any older versions of browsers with which this target version is not compatible, then they can use packages like babel to transpile to a older target.

## 2.0.0-internal.5.4.0

### Minor Changes

-   Deprecate Internal TelemetryLogger Implementations ([#16385](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/issues/16385)) [64023cacb1](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/64023cacb13767c46c0472ecc22559aaad67adad)

    This change deprecates our internal TelemetryLogger implementations and unifies our exported and consumed surface area on our telemetry interfaces.

    For the deprecated implementations the following replacement function should be used:

    -   replace ChildLogger.create, new TelemetryNullLogger, and new BaseTelemetryNullLogger with createChildLogger
    -   replace new MultiSinkLogger with createMultiSinkLogger
    -   replace TelemetryUTLogger with MockLogger
    -   DebugLogger.create will be made internal with no intended replacement

## 2.0.0-internal.5.1.0

### Minor Changes

-   Logger interface now supports logging a flat object ([#15759](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/issues/15759)) [8ae4fe32b1](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/8ae4fe32b11d9bdfe6d2d43950970c95bdc660a6)

    The internal logger interface used when instrumenting the code now supports logging a flat object,
    which will be JSON.stringified before being sent to the host's base logger.
    This is technically a breaking change but based on typical logger configuration, should not require any changes to accommodate.

## 2.0.0-internal.5.0.0

### Major Changes

-   `ITelemetryLoggerExt` is a replacement for `ITelemetryLogger`, which adds additional types that can be logged as property values. ([#15667](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/pull-requests/15667)) [8c851e4c4b](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/8c851e4c4b9a18a5189ace0608a1d8c3190a606b)
    This interface is not expected to be used outside the codebase, and all Logger implementations already use the new interface.
    In this release, the new type is used throughout the codebase to allow richer instrumentation.

    It's unlikely this will manifest as a break to consumers of the package, but it's not impossible.
