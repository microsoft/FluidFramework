 *
 * @remarks
 * The sampling functionality uses the Fluid telemetry logging configuration along with the optionally provided event sampling callback to determine whether an event should
 * be logged or not.
 *
 * Configuration object parameters:
 * 'Fluid.Telemetry.DisableSampling': if this config value is set to true, all events will be unsampled and therefore logged.
 * Otherwise only a sample will be logged according to the provided event sampler callback.
 *
 * Note that the same sampler is used for all APIs of the returned logger. If you want separate events flowing through the returned logger to be sampled separately, the {@link IEventSampler} you provide should track them separately.
