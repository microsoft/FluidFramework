            <h1>Prague Demos</h1>
            <p>
                For all demos you'll want to have two browser windows open side by side. Open this page in the left
                browser window and use it to open links for both windows.
            </p>
            <p>
                To create a new set of links refresh this page.
            </p>

            <h2>Performance</h2>
            <p>
                Open a copy of the links listed below in each of the browser windows. Show the same page side by side.
                Pick a line and hold the space bar. Then hold down the backspace key to delete the spaces. Repeat this
                process as many times as you want. The test shows the local client performance as well as the remote
                client performance. To ink in the Prague example either use a pen or click the ink checkbox in the
                bottom status bar and then use the mouse.
            </p>

            </ul>

            <h2>Augmentation Loop</h2>
            <p>
                You have the option to either have scribe automatically
                type some text. Or you can manually load the documents and type yourself.
            </p>

            <h3>Manual</h3>
            <p>
                Open one link in the left browser and the other in the right. Ctrl+B will bold text and Ctrl+U will underline.
            </p>
            <ul class="list-unstyled">
                <li><a href="/loader/fluid/{{translateMoniker}}?chaincode=@chaincode/shared-text@{{version}}&languageFrom=en&languageTo=el" target="_blank">Greek</a></li>
                <li><a href="/loader/fluid/{{translateMoniker}}?chaincode=@chaincode/shared-text@{{version}}&languageFrom=en&languageTo=es" target="_blank">Spanish</a></li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Automatic</h3>
            <p>
                Open the link below, click on the create button, then open the links to the translation documents. Then click
                Start. You will want to keep the Scribe page active (i.e. in its own window or in an active tab) since
                otherwise the browser may stop it from running JavaScript which will pause the demo.
            </p>
            <ul class="list-unstyled">
                <li><a href="/loader/fluid/{{scribeMoniker}}?chaincode=@chaincode/scribe@{{version}}&language=el,es&speed=100&text=/public/literature/translate-demo.txt" target="_blank">Scribe</a></li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Feature Differentiation</h2>
            <p>
                Open the link below in both browser windows. Start typing in lines of text. We usually just like to do
                <blockquote>
                    This is the firt line</br>
                    This is the second line</br>
                    This is the third line</br>
                    This is the fourth line</br>
                </blockquote>
                Note it has a purposeful spelling mistake on the first line.
            </p>
            <p>
                Then click on the branch button in the bottom status bar. Open the branch document in the other browser page. Add a
                line to the bottom of the document. Show how it goes to both branch documents.
            </p>
            <p>
                Switch a tab back to the original document. Show that the branch update didn't apply. Now fix the spelling
                mistake or add a new line. It will go to both the original and the branch.
            </p>
