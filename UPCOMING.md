# Upcoming changes in Fluid Framework v2.0.0-internal.5.2.0

## IConnectionDetailsInternal and IDeltaHandlerStrategy deprecated

The IConnectionDetailsInternal and IDeltaHandlerStrategy interfaces from the @fluidframework/container-definitions package have been deprecated and will be removed in a future release. These are internal-only interfaces and should not be used.

## Deprecate unnecessary exports

This change deprecates a number of interfaces in the merge tree package that are not used in the exported apis surface and therefore should not be used.

## Deprecate ISegment.parent

This change deprecates the parent property on the ISegment interface. The property will still exist, but should not generally be used by outside consumers.

There are some circumstances where a consumer may wish to know if a segment is still in the underlying tree and were using the parent property to determine that.

Please change those checks to use the following `"parent" in segment && segment.parent !== undefined`
