The SummarizerStopReason, ISummarizeEventProps, and ISummarizerEvents interfaces are moved to container-runtime-definitions

`SummarizerStopReason`, `ISummarizeEventProps`, and `ISummarizerEvents` have all been removed from the `"@fluidframework/container-runtime"` package. Please migrate all uses of these APIs to their respective copies in the `"@fluidframework/container-runtime-definitions"` package.
