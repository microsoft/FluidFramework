Summarizer-related types have been moved to container-runtime-definitions

`SummarizerStopReason`, `ISummarizeEventProps`, and `ISummarizerEvents` have all been moved from the
`"@fluidframework/container-runtime"` package to `@fluidframework/container-runtime-definitions`.

Users should now import them from `@fluidframework/container-runtime-definitions`.
