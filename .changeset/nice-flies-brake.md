The inbound and outbound properties have been removed from IDeltaManager

The inbound and outbound properties were deprecated in a previous release and have been removed from IDeltaManager. Please check pull request [#19636](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/pull/19636) for alternative APIs.

This is the link to the [Release Notes](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/blob/main/RELEASE_NOTES/2.0.0-rc.2.0.0.md#container-definitions-deprecate-ideltamanagerinbound-and-ideltamanageroutbound)
which contains more instructions on the alternatives.
