Recursive SharedTree schemas using MapNodes no longer produce invalid d.ts files

Consider a recursive SharedTree schema like the following, which follows all our recommended best practices:

```typescript
export class RecursiveMap extends schema.mapRecursive("RM", [() => RecursiveMap]) {}
{
	type _check = ValidateRecursiveSchema<typeof RecursiveMap>;
}
```

This schema would work when used from within its compilation unit, but would generate d.ts that fails to compile when exporting it:

```typescript
declare const RecursiveMap_base: import("@fluidframework/tree").TreeNodeSchemaClass<"com.example.RM", import("@fluidframework/tree").NodeKind.Map, import("@fluidframework/tree").TreeMapNodeUnsafe<readonly [() => typeof RecursiveMap]> & import("@fluidframework/tree").WithType<"com.example.RM">, {
    [Symbol.iterator](): Iterator<[string, RecursiveMap], any, undefined>;
}, false, readonly [() => typeof RecursiveMap]>;
export declare class RecursiveMap extends RecursiveMap_base {
}
```

This results in the compile error in TypeScript 5.4.5:

> error TS2310: Type 'RecursiveMap' recursively references itself as a base type.

With this change, that error is fixed by modifying the `TreeMapNodeUnsafe` type it references to inline the definition of `ReadonlyMap` instead of using the one from the TypeScript standard library.
