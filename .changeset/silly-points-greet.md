Temporarily restore parent property on ISegment

The `parent` property on `ISegment` has been temporarily restored to ease the transition to `2.0.0-internal.6.x`.
It will be removed again in `2.0.0-internal.7.0.0`.

The original deprecation announcement can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/releases/tag/client_v2.0.0-internal.5.2.0).
