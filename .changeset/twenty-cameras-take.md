Untangle `PresenceStates` methods and properties

`PresenceStatesEntries` which represent each of the states in `PresenceStates` schema have been relocated from directly within `PresenceStates` to under property names `prop`. Only the `add` method remains. (Type `PresenceStatesMethods` has been removed.)
