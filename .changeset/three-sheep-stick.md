The functions `process` and `processDocumentSchemaOp` have been removed.

`process` has been replaced by `processMessages` from the following:
- `DocumentsSchemaController`
- `FluidDataStoreRuntime`
- `IDeltaHandler`
- `IFluidDataStoreChannel`
- `MockFluidDataStoreRuntime`
- `MockDeltaConnection`

`processDocumentSchemaOp` has been replaced by `processDocumentSchemaMessages` from `DocumentsSchemaController`.
