Ephemeral containers now controlled in attach() call rather than as driver policy

Previously, ephemeral containers were created by adding an isEphemeralContainer flag in IRouterliciousDriverPolicies. Now, it is controlled by a createAsEphemeral flag on the resolved URL. See https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/pull/19544 for an example of how to set this flag via your URL resolver.
