Removed IContainer.getContainerPackageInfo()

`IContainer.getContainerPackageInfo()` was set to be removed in release 2.40.0. To access the package name `getContainerPackageInfo()` provided, use `IFluidCodeDetails.package` returned by `IContainer.getLoadedCodeDetails()`.

See [issue #23898](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/issues/23898) for more information.
