Experimental Presence package added

**[@fluid-experimental/presence](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/tree/main/packages/framework/presence#readme)** is now available for investigation. The new package is meant to support presence of collaborators connected to the same container. Use this library to quickly share simple, non-persisted data among all clients or send/receive fire and forget notifications.

API documentation for **@fluid-experimental/presence** is available at <https://fluidframework.com/docs/apis/presence>.

There are some limitations; see the README.md of installed package for most relevant notes.

We're just getting started. Please give it a go and share feedback.
