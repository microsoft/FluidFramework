Experimental Presence package added

**@fluid-experimental/presence** is now available for investigation. The new package is meant to support presence of collaborators connected to the same container. Use this library to quickly share simple, non-persisted data among all client connected or fire and forget notifications.

API documentation for **@fluid-experimental/presence** is available at <https://fluidframework.com/docs/apis/presence>.

There are some limitations; we're just getting started. Please give it a go and share feedback.
