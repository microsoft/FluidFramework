Rename and change type of annotatedAllowedTypeSet on FieldSchemaAlpha to more closely align with allowedTypesSet

This changes the `annotatedAllowedTypeSet` property on [`FieldSchemaAlpha`](https://fluidframework.com/docs/api/fluid-framework/fieldschemaalpha-class).
It is now called `annotatedAllowedTypesNormalized` and stores evaluated schemas along with their annotations in a list of objects rather than as a mapping from the schemas to their annotations. This makes the API easier to use and better aligns with the current public APIs.
