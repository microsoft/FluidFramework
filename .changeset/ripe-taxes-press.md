Target ES2021

The TypeScript build has been updated to target ES2021 instead of ES2020.
This may result in newer JavaScript language features being used.
This does not include updating the library version being used.
We only support users which support ES2022, so updating to target ES2021 should not break any supported use-case.
Any users which do not have at least ES2021 language feature support may need transpile out some additional cases after this change.

This should result is slightly reduced bundle size and slightly improved performance for users not transpiling these features out.
No major changes are expected.
