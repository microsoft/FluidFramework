The `ITelemetryProperties` interface was deprecated and has been removed.
Use the identical `ITelemetryBaseProperties` instead.

it had moved to `@fluidframework/telemetry-utils` in the past.

The `TelemetryEventPropertyType` type alias was deprecated and has been removed.
Use the identical `TelemetryBaseEventPropertyType` instead.

The `ITaggedTelemetryPropertyType` interface was deprecated and has been removed.
Use `Tagged<TelemetryBaseEventPropertyType>` instead.
