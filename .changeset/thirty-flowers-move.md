Change the API tags for telemetry-related items to the more restrictive @alpha tag

To enhance control and oversight during the development phase, we will transition the API tags for all telemetry-related items to the @alpha tag. This change aims to signify that these APIs are in the early testing stages and may undergo significant modifications based on feedback and further testing. The @alpha tag indicates that these features are not yet finalized and should be used with caution, as they are subject to potential changes which could affect stability and compatibility. This adjustment will help manage expectations and ensure that developers are aware of the developmental nature of these telemetry features.
