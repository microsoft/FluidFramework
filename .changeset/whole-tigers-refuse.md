EventForwarder and IDisposable members deprecated from PureDataObject

The EventForwarder and IDisposable members have been deprecated from PureDataObject and will be removed in an upcoming release. The EventForwarder pattern was mostly unused by the current implementation, and is also recommended against generally (instead, register and forward events explicitly). The disposal implementation was incomplete and likely to cause poor behavior as the disposal was not observable by default. Inheritors of the PureDataObject can of course still implement their own disposal logic.
