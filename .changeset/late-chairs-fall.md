IContainer.getContainerPackageInfo() is now deprecated

The `IContainer.getContainerPackageInfo()` function is now deprecated. This API will be removed in 2.40.
Use `IFluidCodeDetails.package` returned by `IContainer.getLoadedCodeDetails()` instead.

See [issue #23898] (https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/issues/23898) for details.
