Packages now use package.json "exports" and require modern module resolution

Fluid Framework packages have been updated to use the [package.json "exports"
field](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v18.x/api/packages.html#exports) to define explicit entry points for both
TypeScript types and implementation code.

This means that using Fluid Framework packages require the following TypeScript settings in tsconfig.json:

- `"moduleResolution": "Node16"` with `"module": "Node16"`
- `"moduleResolution": "Bundler"` with `"module": "ESNext"`

We recommend using Node16/Node16 unless absolutely necessary. That will produce transpiled JavaScript that is suitable
for use with modern versions of Node.js _and_ Bundlers.
[See the TypeScript documentation](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#moduleResolution) for more information
regarding the module and moduleResolution options.

**Node10 moduleResolution is not supported; it does not support Fluid Framework's API structuring pattern that is used
to distinguish stable APIs from those that are in development.**
