New package: @fluidframework/fluid-telemetry

Before deploying your application at scale, it is critical to have the holistic telemetry in place to monitor its usage
and look for issues and optimizations. To make this easier, we are providing a fluid-telemetry package that comes with
Typed telemetry events that you can funnel to your any analytics tool of your choice. If you decide to use Azure App
Insights to view this data, we also provide helper packages and dashboard queries to get you started quickly. You can
learn more at <https://aka.ms/fluid/telemetry>.
