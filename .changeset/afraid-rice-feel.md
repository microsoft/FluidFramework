TreeAlpha.create now accepts unhydrated nodes

[TreeAlpha.create](https://fluidframework.com/docs/api/fluid-framework/treealpha-interface#create-methodsignature) now accepts [unhydrated](https://fluidframework.com/docs/api/fluid-framework/unhydrated-typealias) nodes.
`TreeAlpha.create`'s documentation has been fixed to indicate support instead of being self contradictory about it.
