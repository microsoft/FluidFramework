Better type errors for invalid recursive schema

Constraints are added to `*Recursive` [`SchemaFactory`](https://fluidframework.com/docs/api/fluid-framework/schemafactory-class) methods to ensure correct use without relying on [`ValidateRecursiveSchema`](https://fluidframework.com/docs/api/fluid-framework/validaterecursiveschema-typealias) as much.
