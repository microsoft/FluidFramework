"rootChanged" event is no longer skipped if first change is setting the root to undefined

A bug has been fixed where [rootChanged](https://fluidframework.com/docs/api/fluid-framework/treeviewevents-interface#rootchanged-methodsignature) would not be fired if the change is the first change since the [TreeView](https://fluidframework.com/docs/api/fluid-framework/treeview-interface) became in-schema, and the change was setting the document root to `undefined`.
