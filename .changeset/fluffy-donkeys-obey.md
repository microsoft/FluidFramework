Presence APIs promoted to beta

[Presence APIs](https://fluidframework.com/docs/build/presence) are now beta and can be imported via `@fluidframework/presence/beta`.

Note: `Notifications` are only supported via `/alpha` imports. To access notifications-only workspace support, cast `Presence` to `PresenceWithNotifications`.
