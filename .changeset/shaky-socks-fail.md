runtime-utils: Removed requestFluidObject

The `requestFluidObject` utility has been removed. Please migrate all usage of it to the new `entryPoint` pattern.

See [Removing-IFluidRouter.md](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/blob/main/packages/common/core-interfaces/Removing-IFluidRouter.md) for more details.
