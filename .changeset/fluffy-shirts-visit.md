Type Erase IFluidDataStoreRuntime.deltaManager

Make IFluidDataStoreRuntime.deltaManager have an opaque type.
Marks the following types which were reachable from it as alpha:

-   IConnectionDetails
-   IDeltaSender
-   IDeltaManagerEvents
-   IDeltaManager
-   IDeltaQueueEvents
-   IDeltaQueue
-   ReadOnlyInfo

As a temporary workaround, users needing access to the full delta manager API can use the `@alpha` `toDeltaManagerInternal` API to retrieve its members, but should migrate away from requiring access to those APIs.

Implementing a custom `IFluidDataStoreRuntime` is not supported: this is now indicated by it being marked with `@sealed`.
