Deprecate SharedSequence, SubSequence, and IJSONRunSegment

The types SharedSequence, SubSequence, and IJSONRunSegment are being deprecated and moved.

They are now, and will continue to be exposed from the @fluid-experimental/sequence-deprecated package.

New usages of these types should not be added, but they may be necessary for migration.
