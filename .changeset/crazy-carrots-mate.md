A minimal set of branching APIs has been promoted to beta.

The following APIs have been promoted to beta in `@fluidframework/tree`:

- `TreeBranch.fork()`
- `TreeBranch.merge()`
- `TreeBranch.rebaseOnto()`
- `TreeBranch.dispose()`
- `TreeView.fork()`

These APIs enable applications to implement basic local branching flows.
