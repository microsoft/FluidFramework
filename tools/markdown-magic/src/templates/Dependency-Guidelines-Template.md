When taking a dependency on a Fluid Framework library, we recommend using a `^` (caret) version range, such as `^1.3.4`.
While Fluid Framework libraries may use different ranges with interdependencies between other Fluid Framework libraries,
library consumers should always prefer `^`.

Note that when depending on a library version of the form `2.0.0-internal.x.y.z`, called the Fluid internal version scheme,
you must use a `>= <` dependency range (such as `>=2.0.0-internal.x.y.z <2.0.0-internal.w.0.0` where `w` is `x+1`).
Standard `^` and `~` ranges will not work as expected.
See the [@fluid-tools/version-tools](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/blob/main/build-tools/packages/version-tools/README.md)
package for more information including tools to convert between version schemes.
