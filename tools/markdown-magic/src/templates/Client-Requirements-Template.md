Fluid Framework client libraries support the platforms in this document.
These requirements are intentionally restrictive.
Within a major version series, we can relax these requirements, but we cannot make them stricter.
For a Long Term Support (LTS) version, we might need to support these platforms for several years.

Other configurations can work, but Fluid Framework does not support them.
If an unsupported configuration stops working, we do not classify this as a bug.
To request support for a configuration that is not listed, file an issue.
The product team will evaluate your request.
In the issue, specify the current status of the configuration:

-   The configuration works but needs official support.
-   The configuration does not work and requires changes.

# Supported Runtimes

-   Fluid Framework supports Node.js versions 22 and 24 while they receive [upstream support](https://nodejs.org/en/about/previous-releases).
    -   Fluid Framework will stop support for version 22 [when upstream support ends on 2027-04-30](https://github.com/nodejs/release#release-schedule).
    -   Fluid Framework does not support Node.js with the `--no-experimental-fetch` flag.
-   Fluid Framework supports modern browsers that support the ES2022 standard library.

# Supported Tools

-   [TypeScript 6.0](https://typescriptdocs.com/release-notes/TypeScript%206.0):
    -   Fluid Framework supports all [`strict`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig) options.
    -   Set the build targets (`lib`, `target`) to `ES2022` or later.
    -   Enable [`strictNullChecks`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig).
    -   Fluid Framework does not support [configuration options deprecated in TypeScript 6.0](https://typescriptdocs.com/release-notes/TypeScript%206.0#breaking-changes-and-deprecations-in-typescript-6-0).
    -   Fluid Framework does not fully support `exactOptionalPropertyTypes`.
        If you enable this option, do not use `in`, `Reflect.has`, `Object.hasOwn`, or `Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty` to narrow members of Fluid Framework types.
        These methods can incorrectly exclude `undefined` from the possible values.
-   [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) 5
    -   We do not require a specific bundler.
        Other bundlers that handle ES Modules can work, but we actively test only webpack.

# Module Resolution

In TypeScript `compilerOptions`, use [`Node16`, `Node20`, `NodeNext`, or `Bundler`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#moduleResolution) module resolution.
These settings follow the [Node.js v12+ ESM Resolution and Loading algorithm](https://nodejs.github.io/nodejs.dev/en/api/v20/esm/#resolution-and-loading-algorithm).

Do not use `Node10` module resolution.

# Module Formats

-   ES Modules:
    Use ES Modules to consume Fluid Framework client packages, including in Node.js.
-   CommonJS:
    Fluid Framework does not officially support CommonJS in version 3.0 or later.
