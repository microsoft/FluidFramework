# @fluid-tools/markdown-magic

This library contains tools for generating and embedding documentation contents in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) documentation.

Note: this package is currently private, and only intended for use in this repository.

## Usage

### Script

To run the `markdown-magic` script against your Markdown files, run the following from the command line:

```shell
npm run markdown-magic [--files <one or more file globs, space-separated>] [--workingDirectory <directory in which to run the script>]
```

#### Arguments

##### `files`

Accepts one or more glob values to match against.
Only file names matching the pattern(s) will have their contents parsed and updated.

Uses the [globby](https://github.com/sindresorhus/globby#readme) format.

**Default**: `**/*.md`

###### Example

```shell
npm run markdown-magic --files \"docs/*\" \"!docs/README.md\"
```

Will run on all Markdown contents under the `docs` directory, except for `!docs/README.md`.

##### `workingDirectory`

Specifies the directory from which the script will be run.
Useful when the directory from which the Node.js process is run is not the hierarchical root from which you wish to run documentation generation.

Default: `Node.js`'s working directory (i.e. the directory from which the script was executed).

###### Example

```shell
npm run markdown-magic --workingDirectory ../../
```

Will run the script from two levels higher in the file structure relative to where the `npm` script itself was executed.

### Transforms

The following is a list of supported transform pragmas that can be included in your Markdown documentation to automatically generate / embed contents.

To include a transform in your document, use the following syntax:

```markdown
<!-- AUTO-GENERATED-CONTENT:START (<transform-name>[:<argument-1>=<value-1>[&<argument-2>=<value-2>...&<argument-N>=<value-N>]]) -->
<!-- AUTO-GENERATED-CONTENT:END -->
```

#### `INCLUDE`

Can be used to embed contents from another file into the Markdown file.

Arguments:

-   `path`: Relative path from the document to the file being embedded.
-   `start`: (optional) First line from the target file to be embedded (inclusive). If positive, the value is relative to the beginning of the file. If negative, the value is relative to the end of the file.
-   `end`: (optional) Limit line from the target file to be embedded (exclusive). If positive, the value is relative to the beginning of the file. If negative, the value is relative to the end of the file.

#### `LIBRARY_PACKAGE_README`

Generates a complete starter `README.md` file for a libary package.

Notes:

-   This strictly intended as a starter template to remove the need for some handwritten boilerplate.
    You will still need to fill in semantic and usage information.
-   This is effectively just a wrapper around lower-level templates.
    If you want more fine-grained control over the content structure, we recommend using other templates.

Arguments:

-   `packageJsonPath`: Relative file path to the library package's `package.json` file.
    Used for generation of package metadata.
    -   Default: `./package.json`.
-   `installation`: Whether or not to include the package "Installation" section.
    -   Default: `true`.

    -   Only observed if `installation` is `true`.
-   `apiDocs`: Whether or not to include a section pointing to the library's generated API documentation on `fluidframework.com`.
    -   Default: `true`.
    -   Assumes that the package is published, uses [API-Extractor][], and has its documentation published under `fluidframework.com/apis/<package-name>`.
    -   See [API_DOCS_LINK_SECTION](#api_docs_link_section)
-   `scripts`: Whether or not to include a section listing the package's `npm` scripts.
