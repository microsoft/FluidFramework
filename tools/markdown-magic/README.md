# @fluid-tools/markdown-magic

This library contains tools for generating and embedding documentation contents in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) documentation.

Note: this package is currently private, and only intended for use in this repository.

## Usage

### Script

To run the `markdown-magic` script against your Markdown files, run the following from the command line:

```shell
npm run markdown-magic [--files <one or more file globs, space-separated>] [--workingDirectory <directory in which to run the script>]
```

#### Arguments

##### `files`

Accepts one or more glob values to match against.
Only file names matching the pattern(s) will have their contents parsed and updated.

Uses the [globby](https://github.com/sindresorhus/globby#readme) format.

**Default**: "**/*.md"

###### Example

```shell
npm run markdown-magic --files \"docs/*\" \"!docs/README.md\"
```

Will run on all Markdown contents under the `docs` directory, except for `!docs/README.md`.

##### `workingDirectory`

Specifies the directory from which the script will be run.
Useful when the directory from which the Node.js process is run is not the hierarchical root from which you wish to run documentation generation.

Default: `Node.js`'s working directory (i.e. the directory from which the script was executed).

###### Example

```shell
npm run markdown-magic --workingDirectory ../../
```

Will run the script from two levels higher in the file structure relative to where the `npm` script itself was executed.
