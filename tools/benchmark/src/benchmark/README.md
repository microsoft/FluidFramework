# benchmark

This directory contains contents derived from https://github.com/bestiejs/benchmark.js and some types from https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/blob/master/types/benchmark/index.d.ts

This copy diverges from the original for a few reasons:

1. The original is javascript not TypeScript.
2. The original support older tools and environments which dropping support for can simplify things.
3. The original can be problematic to make work with bundlers, particularly from TypeScript.
4. The original supports more features than we need (like suites).
