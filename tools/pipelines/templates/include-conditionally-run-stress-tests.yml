# tests will only be executed if the commit associated with this pipeline touched some of the files
# in the 'affectedPaths' subparameter.

# Needed to workaround a bug in the DownloadPipelineArtifact task that might cause artifacts to be downloaded from the
# incorrect pipeline run (see https://github.com/microsoft/azure-pipelines-tasks/issues/13518).
