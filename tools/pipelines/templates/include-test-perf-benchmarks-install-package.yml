# This template is intended to be used for common steps across stages of the test-perf-benchmarks.yml pipeline.
# It downloads (from the artifacts produced by another pipeline) and installs a specified package that has performance tests.

parameters:
# Identifier for the pipeline that produced the artifact with the package to be installed.
# Will be used for the 'pipeline' input for a DownloadPipelineArtifact task.
- name: artifactPipeline
  type: string

# Identifier for the pipeline run that produced the artifact with the package to be installed.
# Will be used for the 'buildId' input for a DownloadPipelineArtifact task.
- name: artifactBuildId
  type: string

# Name of the package to be installed.
- name: testPackageName
  type: string

# Path where the package should be installed. This template assumes an appropriate .npmrc file was already setup there
# so dependencies can be resolved from our feeds.
- name: installPath
  type: string
