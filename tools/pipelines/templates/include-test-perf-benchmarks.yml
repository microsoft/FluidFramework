# This template is specifically intended to be used for common steps required across different stages
# of test-perf-benchmarks.yml pipeline. It performs some common setup that all stages need to do.

parameters:
# Identifier for the pipeline that produced the artifact with the test files.
# Will be used for the 'pipeline' input for a DownloadPipelineArtifact task.
- name: artifactPipeline
  type: string

# Identifier for the pipeline run that produced the artifact with the test files.
# Will be used for the 'buildId' input for a DownloadPipelineArtifact task.
- name: artifactBuildId
  type: string

# Path where the packages with perf tests will be installed.
# The template will create it, and install aria-logger in it.
- name: testWorkspace
  type: string

# Path to the folder where the test files artifact should be downloaded.
- name: testFilesPath
  type: string

# Path where the telemetry-generator package should be installed.
# It should be an empty directory so that it doesn't interfere with anything else.
# The caller of this template will need to know this in order to point to the correct locations for the handlers,
# which will be under <this path>/node_modules/@ff-internal/telemetry-generator/dist/handlers/.
