# The include-setup-npmrc-for-download template creates an .npmrc file which uses the appropriate feeds from our ADO
# org to download packages from the right locations, adds the necessary authentication to it, and sets configuration so
# for the rest of the job execution all invocations of npm (EXCEPT installs through Npm@ tasks) use it.
# The file is created in a "global" location that should not interfere with anything else.
#
# Npm@ tasks always override the user-level .npmrc file with one of their own, so they do not work with this
# configuration. For that reason, using them to install dependencies should be avoided. Using them for other kinds
# of npm invocations should be fine.

parameters:
# URL for the feed in our ADO project that serves as centralized default location to download any dependency.

# URL for the "Office feed" in our ADO project. Packages in the @microsoft scope will be resolved from here when
# installing the dependencies for telemetry generator and aria-logger.

# Location for the .npmrc file that will be used to authenticate to the internal ADO feeds.
# This is a global location that will be used by all npm tasks in the pipeline.
