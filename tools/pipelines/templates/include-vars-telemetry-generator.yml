# Common variables for pipelines that want to use the telemetry-generator tool

variables:
# Where to install the telemetry-generator tool. Chosen so it won't interfere with any other installed packages.
# Note: telemetry-generator is not installed by default in any pipeline. In order for this variable to be of any use,
# it should be passed to the include-telemetry-setup.yml template as the 'pathForTelemetryGeneratorInstall' parameter.
# Then it can be used when running telemetry-generator.
- name: pathToTelemetryGenerator
  value: $(Agent.TempDirectory)/telemetry-generator
  readonly: true

# Path where the handlers for telemetry-generator are located. Convenient because every call to the tool needs to
# provide this as an absolute path.
- name: pathToTelemetryGeneratorHandlers
  value: $(pathToTelemetryGenerator)/node_modules/@ff-internal/telemetry-generator/dist/handlers
  readonly: true

# Same semantics as above two variables, but for pipelines that use the new ff_pipeline_host repository setup
# for shared internal dependencies.
- name: pathToTelemetryGeneratorNew
  value: $(Build.SourcesDirectory)/node_modules/@ff-internal/telemetry-generator

- name: pathToTelemetryGeneratorHandlersNew
