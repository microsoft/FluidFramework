  # Note: we tried to centralize the use of the 'container-registry-info' variable group (i.e. put it inside the shared
  # build-docker-service.yml template) but ran into issues because if it exists in the stage-level variables of the template
  # instead of in the root-level variables of a pipeline, then the value for the ACR service connection name (which comes
  # from the variable group) that gets passed to a Docker@1 task seems to not be available before ADO performs checks for
  # that task, including that the specified service connection exists and the pipeline is authorized to use it. So ADO ends
  # uplooking for a service connection named "$(containerRegistryConnection)" instead of the actual value after replacement.
