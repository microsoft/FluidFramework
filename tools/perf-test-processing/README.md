# @fluid-tools/perf-test-processing

Internal tool to process the output of our performance benchmark tests and write relevant metrics to our monitoring
systems.

## Running locally

Install dependencies and build the project:

```bash
npm i
npm run build
```

Run the tool, passing as arguments one or more folders that contain performance test output files generated by
the `@fluid-tools/benchmark` tool, when called with the appropriate options to generate output JSON files. E.g.:

```bash
node dist/index.js '/workspaces/FluidFramework/experimental/dds/tree/benchOutput' '/workspaces/FluidFramework/packages/dds/tree/benchOutput'
```
