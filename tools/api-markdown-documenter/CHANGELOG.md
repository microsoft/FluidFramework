## 0.14.0

-   Allow configuration of "alerts" in child item tables.
    -   Default behavior can be overridden via the the `getAlertsForItem` option.

### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

-   Update default policy for `getHeadingTextForItem` to not insert `(BETA)` and `(ALPHA)` postfixes based on release tags.
    If this is the desired behavior, it can be replicated by overriding `getHeadingTextForItem` to do so.

## 0.13.0

### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

-   Removed support for generating front-matter.
    Front-matter generation was never properly designed, and did not fit well into the transformation flow as it was implemented.
    If you require front-matter in the documents you generate, you can inject it by rendering the `DocumentNode`s generated by `transformApiModel`.

## 0.12.2

-   Fixed an issue where variable item tables did not include type information in default ApiItem transformations.
-   Add variable and property type information to associated details sections in default ApiItem transformations.
-   Further improved error messages when an unexpected child kind is encountered when iterating over children in default ApiItem transformations.

## 0.12.1

-   Improved error messages when an unexpected child kind is encountered when iterating over children in default ApiItem transformations.

## 0.12.0

-   Added functionality for transforming Documentation Domain trees to [hast](https://github.com/syntax-tree/hast).
    The main entrypoint for this is: `documentToHtml`.
-   Updated the package to emit ESM only.
-   Fixed a bug where [inline tags](https://tsdoc.org/pages/spec/tag_kinds/#inline-tags) (other than `{@link}` and `{@inheritDoc}`, which are handled specially by API-Extractor) were not handled and resulted in errors being logged to the console.
    Such tags are now handled in the following way:
    -   [{@label}](https://tsdoc.org/pages/tags/label/) tags are simply omitted from the output (they are intended as metadata, not documentation content).
    -   Other custom inline tags are emitted as italicized text.
-   Fixed a bug where pre-escaped text contents (including embedded HTML content) would be incorrectly re-escaped.
-   Fixed a bug where type parameter information was only being generated for `interface` and `class` items.
-   Adds "Constraint" and "Default" columns to type parameter tables when any are present among the type parameters.
-   Fixed a bug where getter/setter properties under interface items did not get documentation generated for them.

### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

-   The package now outputs ESM only.
    Consumers will have to migrate accordingly.
-   `DocumentationNode` now has a required `isEmpty` property.
    Implementations will need to provide this.
-   Update the signature of `createTypeParametersSection` to always generate a `SectionNode` when called, such that consumers don't have to handle a potentially undefined return value.
    If the consumer wants to omit the section (for example when the list of type parameters is empty), they can make the call conditional on their end.
-   Removed `createDocumentWriter`, and exported `DocumentWriter` is now an interface rather than a class.
    A `DocumentWriter` may be instantiated via `DocumentWriter.create` (or you can use your own implementation, which was not previously supported).
-   Update `typescript` dependency from `4.x` to `5.x`.
