Like any framework introducing new concepts / paradigms, the Fluid Framework has a set of native terminology that we use frequently.

To lower the barrier to entry, and generally make our documentation more accessible, it is important that we are consistent in the ways we refer to our concepts.
This document outlines common dos and don'ts regarding our terminology.

## Terminology

-   "Fluid" and "Fluid Framework" are a proper nouns and should be capitalized, but these are not:
    -   "container"
    -   "service"
    -   "object"
    -   "driver"
    -   "runtime"
    -   "host"

-   "Fluid service", not "Fluid server"

## Casing

-   "Container code", not "Container Code"
-   "Distributed data structures", not "Distributed Data Structures"
-   "URL", not "url" or "Url"
-   "TypeScript", not "Typescript"
-   "Node.js", not "node" or "nodejs", etc.
-   "npm" (always lower-case)
