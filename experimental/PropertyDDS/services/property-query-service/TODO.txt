# Fix the stripReversible function in PropertySets
# Selecting the name of an asset (root.asset.17.name) in the synthetic dataset gave the wrong CS
# Tests sometimes get stuck in an infinite loop (run this code node test_server.js synthetic -t 32 -a 0.2 in commit: 5214619bc655d3376a26811ef9bf483332b68216)
# run this code node test_server.js synthetic -t 32 -a 0.2 in commit: 5214619bc655d3376a26811ef9bf483332b68216

# There are a few boundary cases where we might still create too big chunks, which could be split again
# Split leaf_splitting_and_merging.spec.js into multiple files
# Error handling is not yet correctly implemented in the notification manager
# use shorter GUID encoding
# Do we currenty modify the original root leaf? Should we prevent that?

# Performance
# 1-2% Settings parsing
# 4-5% isEmpty in NodeDependencyManager
# 20-40% Node parsing and stringifying
# Multi core implementation
