/**
 * @fileoverview This file was derived using the tsd-jsdoc tool (https://www.npmjs.com/package/tsd-jsdoc).
 * Specifically, by running 'jsdoc -t node_modules/tsd-jsdoc -r src/' in the databinder repo. The following
 * modifications had to be made after running this tool (ideally, the above tool would output the correct
 * declaration file without modification):
 *
 * 1. The addition of a 'declare module' statement so that *.ts files that import '@fluid-experimental/property-binder'
 *    pick up definitions from this file.
 * 2. By wrapping everything in the 'declare module' statement, all of the 'declare' statements had to change to
 *    'export'.
 * 3. tsd-jsdoc appears to not handle object parameters correctly, adding them as
 *    (params: any, params.arg0: any, ..., params.argn: any), which is a syntax error in typescript.
