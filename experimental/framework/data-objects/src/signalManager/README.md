## SignalManager
The `SignalManager` is a DataObject that can be used to communicate transient data via signals.

### Usage
`SignalManager` is the most appropriate tool to share transient data using Fluid.  Transient data refers to short-lived and impermanent information that is not required to be persisted.

User presence scenarios are key examples of situations where sending transient data is of interest, as users are required to tell other users their own information and their past data is mostly irrelavant. Using `SignalManager` over other distributed data strucurtes in these scenarios is beneficial, as it's usage does not result in the storage of data that is not useful in the long-term.
