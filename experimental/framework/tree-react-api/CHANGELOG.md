### Minor Changes

- Simplify experimental tree data object implementation ([#23943](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/pull/23943)) [00a56b79b3](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commit/00a56b79b3ba517d56bbde4421fee0cdbfe8af95)

  The experimental tree data object in `tree-react-api` has been simplified in a way that is incompatible with its previous version, which used `SharedDirectory` at the root.
  The library now leverages a new data object that uses the `SharedTree` directly at the root.
  In addition to breaking compatibility with existing documents, these changes include some related simplifications to the APIs which are also breaking:

  - Removes the `key` property from the data object configuration.
    This key was used to inform where the SharedTree was parented beneath the root SharedDirectory, so it no longer serves a purpose.
  - Inlined the `ITreeDataObject` interface into `IReactTreeDataObject`.
