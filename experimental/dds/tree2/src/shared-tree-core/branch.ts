 * on the branch before the operation but are no longer present after) and the "new commits" (all
 * commits which are present on the branch after the operation that were not present before). Each of
 * the following event types also provides a `change` which contains the net change to the branch
 * (or is undefined if there was no net change):
 * * Append - when one or more commits are appended to the head of the branch, for example via
 * a change applied by the branch's editor, or as a result of merging another branch into this one
 * * Remove - when one or more commits are removed from the head of the branch. This occurs
 * when a transaction is aborted and all commits pending in that transaction are removed.
 * * Replace - when an operation simultaneously removes and appends commits. For example, when this
 * branch is rebased and some commits are removed and replaced with rebased versions, or when a
 * transaction completes and all pending commits are replaced with a single squash commit.
