 *
 * - Allow replacing the whole set with a structural type for terminal / non-tree data,
 * and use this as a replacement for values on the tree nodes.
 *
 * - Allow expression structural constraints for child trees, for example requiring specific traits
 * (ex: via TreeNodeStoredSchema), instead of by type.
 *
 * There are two ways this could work:
 *
 * - Constrain the child nodes based on their shape:
 * this makes schema safe editing difficult because nodes would incur extra editing constraints to prevent them
 * from going out of schema based on their location in such a field.
 *
 * - Constrain the types allowed based on which types guarantee their data will always meet the constraints.
 *
 * Care would need to be taken to make sure this is sound for the schema updating mechanisms.
