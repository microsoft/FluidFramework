 * Consider the commit graph below containing two branches, X and Y, with head commits C and E, respectively.
 * Branch Y branches off of Branch X at their common ancestor commit A, i.e. "Y is based off of X at commit A".
 *
 *   A ─ B ─ C ← Branch X
 *   └─ D ─ E ← Branch Y
 *
 * Branch Y is then rebased onto Branch X. This results in the following commit graph:

 *   A ─ B ─ C ← Branch X
 *           └─ D'─ E'← Branch Y
 *
 * Commits D' and E' are the rebased versions of commits D and E, respectively. This results in:
 * deletedSourceCommits: [D, E],
