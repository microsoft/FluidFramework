/**
 * Implementation notes:
 *
 * The visit is organized in two passes: a detach pass and an attach pass.
 * The core idea is that before content can be attached, it must first exist and be in a detached field.
 * The detach pass is therefore responsible for making sure that all roots that needs to be attached during the
 * attach pass are ready to be attached.
 * In practice, this means the detach pass must:
 * - Create all subtrees that need to be created
 * - Detach all moved nodes
 *
 * In addition to that, the detach pass also detaches nodes that need removing, with the exception of nodes that get
 * replaced. The reason for this exception is that we need to be able to communicate replaces as atomic operations.
 * In order to do that, we need to wait until we are sure that the content to attach is available as a detached root.
 * Replaces are therefore handled during the attach pass.
 * Note that this could theoretically lead to a situation where, in the attach pass, one replace wants to attach
 * a node that has yet to be detached by another replace. This does not occur in practice because we do not support
 * editing operations that would lead to this situation.
