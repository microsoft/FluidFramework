 * These anchors are used instead of just holding onto the node objects in forests for several reasons:
 *
 * - Update policy might be more complex than just tracking a node object in the forest.
 *
 * - Not all forests will have node objects: some may use compressed binary formats with no objects to reference.
 *
 * - Anchors are needed even when not using forests, and for nodes that are outside the currently loaded part of the
 * forest.
 *
 * - Forest in general do not need to support up pointers, but they are needed for anchors.
 *
 * Thus this can be thought of as a sparse copy of the subset of trees which are used as anchors,
 * plus the parent paths for them.
 *
 * ReferenceCountedBase tracks the number of references to this from external sources (`Anchors` via `AnchorSet`.).
 * Kept alive as if any of the follow are true:
 * 1. there are children.
 * 2. refcount is non-zero.
 * 3. events are registered.
