/**
 * This file exists and is package exported to aid in testing of exporting recursive types across package boundaries.
 * Sometimes when TypeScript generates d.ts files, they type check significantly differently than the original source (One example of this: https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/20979).
 * Unfortunately our recursive schema types are an example of types that have this kind of issue: the d.ts files tend to get "any" instead of the recursive type reference.
 * Currently we do not have tooling in place to test this in our test suite, and exporting these types here is a temporary crutch to aid in diagnosing this issue.
