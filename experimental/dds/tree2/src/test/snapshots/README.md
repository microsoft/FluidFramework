These snapshot tests exist to validate the backward-compatibility of the persisted format of shared-tree.

This is useful in two scenarios:

1. Identifying unintentional changes to the persisted format
2. Making it possible to diff intentional changes in the persisted format.

The trees in this test suite are intended to exercise end-to-end tree construction cases with interesting edit history and internal state, not just those having interesting shapes.

### Running

Snapshot tests are run as part of the regular test run (`npm run test`).

To run them in isolation, you can run `npm run test:snapshots` from the `tree2` package.

### Updating and Regenerating

If adding a new test or if you've intentionally made a change to the persisted format, you will have to regenerate the test files. To do so, you can run: `npm run test:snapshots:regen`.

### Unintentional Changes

If you find that the snapshot tests break, this means you've modified the persisted format of SharedTree. This generally comes with compatibility consequences:

1. Can previous versions of `@fluid-experimental/tree2` correctly parse the content of the new snapshot?
2. Can the current version of `@fluid-experimental/tree2` correctly parse snapshots that might exist "in the wild?"

If the answer is "yes" to both questions, you can update the snapshots by [regenerating the snapshots](#updating-and-regenerating). Otherwise, your feature needs careful planning with compatibility in mind: see [schema versioning.md] for some best practices.
