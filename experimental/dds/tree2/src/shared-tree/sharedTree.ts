	 *
	 * @remarks
	 * Doing initialization here, regardless of `AllowedUpdateType`, allows a small API that is hard to use incorrectly.
	 * Other approach tend to have leave easy to make mistakes.
	 * For example, having a separate initialization function means apps can forget to call it, making an app that can only open existing document,
	 * or call it unconditionally leaving an app that can only create new documents.
	 * It also would require the schema to be passed into to separate places and could cause issues if they didn't match.
	 * Since the initialization function couldn't return a typed tree, the type checking wouldn't help catch that.
	 * Also, if an app manages to create a document, but the initialization fails to get persisted, an app that only calls the initialization function
	 * on the create code-path (for example how a schematized factory might do it),
	 * would leave the document in an unusable state which could not be repaired when it is reopened (by the same or other clients).
	 * Additionally, once out of schema content adapters are properly supported (with lazy document updates),
	 * this initialization could become just another out of schema content adapter: at tha point it clearly belong here in schematize.
	 *
	 * TODO:
	 * - Implement schema-aware API for return type.
	 * - Support adapters for handling out of schema data.
