	 * If the tree is uninitialized (has no schema and no content), the tree is initialized with the provided `initialTree` and `schema`.
	 *
	 * The tree (now known to have been initialized) has its stored schema checked against the provided view `schema`.
	 *
	 * If the schema are compatible (including updating the stored schema if permitted via `allowedSchemaModifications`),
	 * a {@link TreeField} for the root of the tree is returned, with a schema aware API based on the provided view schema.
	 *
	 * If the schema are not compatible, and exception is thrown.
	 *
	 * @privateRemarks
	 * TODO: make the mismatch case recoverable.
	 * - Provide a way to make a generic view schema for any document.
	 * - Produce/throw the error in a document recoverable way (ex: specific exception type or return value).
	 * TODO: Document and handle what happens when the stored schema changes after schematize has returned. Is some invalidation contract needed? How does editable tree behave?
	 * TODO: Clarify lifetimes. Ensure calling schematize multiple times does not leak.
	 * TODO: Support adapters for handling out of schema data.
	 *
	 * Doing initialization here, regardless of `AllowedUpdateType`, allows a small API that is hard to use incorrectly.
	 * Other approach tend to have leave easy to make mistakes.
	 * For example, having a separate initialization function means apps can forget to call it, making an app that can only open existing document,
	 * or call it unconditionally leaving an app that can only create new documents.
	 * It also would require the schema to be passed into to separate places and could cause issues if they didn't match.
	 * Since the initialization function couldn't return a typed tree, the type checking wouldn't help catch that.
	 * Also, if an app manages to create a document, but the initialization fails to get persisted, an app that only calls the initialization function
	 * on the create code-path (for example how a schematized factory might do it),
	 * would leave the document in an unusable state which could not be repaired when it is reopened (by the same or other clients).
	 * Additionally, once out of schema content adapters are properly supported (with lazy document updates),
	 * this initialization could become just another out of schema content adapter: at tha point it clearly belong here in schematize.
