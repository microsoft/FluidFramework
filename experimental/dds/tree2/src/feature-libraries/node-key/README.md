# Node Key

Nodes keys provide references to nodes in a shared tree.

## Local Node Keys

Local node keys are an efficient representation of a node key and are unique within the local session (machine memory).

## Stable Node Keys

Stable node keys are UUIDs that are globally unique and can be persisted outside of the document.
