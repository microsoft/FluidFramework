	 * - the node currently occupying this field, if it does not involve a field change
	 *
	 * @privateRemarks - Indexing by the revision which deleted the node rather than the one that inserted the node is necessary to support rebase.
	 * Consider rebasing an OptionalChangeset with changes to the 'start' node over one which also has a fieldChange. This would require naming the
	 * original base revision (as 'start' no longer semantically refers to the correct place).
	 *
	 * TODO: This isn't really `deletedBy` as it is so much `contentBefore`, i.e. similar semantics to how childChange worked before.
