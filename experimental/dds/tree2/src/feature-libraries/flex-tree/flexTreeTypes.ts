/**
 * A {@link FlexTreeNode} that wraps a single {@link FlexTreeField} (which is placed under the {@link EmptyKey}).
 *
 * @remarks
 * A FieldNode is mostly identical to a struct node with a single field using the {@link EmptyKey}, but provides access to it via a field named "content".
 *
 * There are several use-cases where it makes sense to use a field node.
 * Here are a few:
 * - When it's necessary to differentiate between an empty sequence, and no sequence.
 * One case where this is needed is encoding Json.
 * - When polymorphism over {@link TreeFieldSchema} (and not just a union of {@link AllowedTypes}) is required.
 * For example when encoding a schema for a type like
 * `Foo[] | Bar[]`, `Foo | Foo[]` or `Optional<Foo> | Optional<Bar>` (Where `Optional` is the Optional field kind, not TypeScript's `Optional`).
 * Since this schema system only allows `|` of {@link TreeNodeSchema} (and only when declaring a {@link TreeFieldSchema}), see {@link SchemaBuilderBase.field},
 * these aggregate types are most simply expressed by creating fieldNodes for the terms like `Foo[]`, and `Optional<Foo>`.
 * Note that these are distinct from types like `(Foo | Bar)[]` and `Optional<Foo | Bar>` which can be expressed as single fields without extra nodes.
 * - When a distinct merge identity is desired for a field.
 * For example, if the application wants to be able to have an optional node or a sequence which it can pass around, edit and observe changes to,
 * in some cases (like when the content is moved to a different parent) this can be more flexible if a field node is introduced
 * to create a separate logical entity (node) which wraps the field.
 * This can even be useful with value fields to wrap terminal nodes if a stable merge
 * - When a field (such as a {@link FlexTreeSequenceField}) is desired in a location where {@link FlexTreeNode}s are required
 * (like the member of a union or the child of another {@link FlexTreeField}).
 * This can is typically just a different perspective on one of the above cases.
 * For example:
 * `Sequence<Foo> | Sequence<Bar>` or `OptionalField<Sequence<Foo>>` can't be expressed as simple fields
 * (unlike `Sequence<Foo | Bar>` or `OptionalField<Foo>` which can be done as simple fields).
 * Instead {@link FlexTreeFieldNode}s can be use to achieve something similar, more like:
 * `FieldNode<Sequence<Foo>> | FieldNode<Sequence<Bar>>` or `OptionalField<FieldNode<Sequence<Foo>>>`.
 *
 * @privateRemarks
 * FieldNodes do not unbox to their content, so in schema aware APIs which do unboxing, the FieldNode will NOT be skipped over.
 * This is a change from the old behavior to simplify unboxing and prevent cases where arbitrary deep chains of field nodes could unbox omitting information about the tree depth.
