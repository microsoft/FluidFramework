	 * The name must be unique among all TreeSchema in the the document schema.
	 *
	 * A field is a node with a single field which captures all its meaning.
	 *
	 * @remarks
	 * Field nodes are mainly a shorthand for a struct with a single field.
	 *
	 * There are several use-cases where it makes sense to use a field node.
	 * Here are a few:
	 * - When it's necessary to differentiate between an empty sequence, and no sequence.
	 * One case where this is needed is encoding Json.
	 * - When polymorphism over file kinds is required.
	 * For example when encoding a schema for a type like
	 * `Foo[] | Bar[]`, `Foo | Foo[]` or `Optional<Foo> | Optional<Bar>` (Where `Optional` is our Optional field kind, not TypeScript's `Optional`).
	 * Since this schema system only allows `|` of {@link TreeSchema} (and only when declaring a {@link FieldSchema}), see {@link SchemaBuilder.field},
	 * these aggregate types are most simply expressed by creating fieldNodes for the terms like `Foo[]`, and `Optional<Foo>`.
	 * Note that these are distinct from types like `(Foo | Bar)[]` and `Optional<Foo | Bar>` which can be expressed as single fields without extra nodes.
	 * - When a distinct merge identity is desired for a field.
	 * For example, if the application wants to be able to have an optional node or a sequence which it can pass around, edit and observe changes to,
	 * in some cases (like when the content is moved to a different parent) this can be more flexible if a field node is introduced
	 * to create a separate logical entity (node) which wraps the field.
	 * This can even be useful with value fields to wrap terminal nodes if a stable merge identity is needed that survives editing the value (which is done by replacing the leaf node).
	 *
	 * Field nodes store their field under the {@link FieldKey} {@link EmptyKey}.
