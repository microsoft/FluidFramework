	 * on if the field's node declares its primary function by means of a primary field (see `getPrimaryField`):
	 * - For `Sequence` multiplicities and "primary fielded" nodes, an array of a {@link ContextuallyTypedNodeData}
	 * or an {@link EditableField} is expected.
	 * Use an empty array to delete all nodes of a sequence field.
	 * - For `Optional` multiplicities, `ContextuallyTypedNodeDataObject | undefined` is expected.
	 * If the input data is `undefined`, the field node will be deleted if it exists.
	 * - For `Value` multiplicities, `ContextuallyTypedNodeDataObject` is expected.
	 *
	 * A `PrimitiveValue` can be used instead of a `ContextuallyTypedNodeDataObject`
	 * to create/replace or to set the value of the primitive node
	 * if the field is a non-sequence and some of its types declare to follow
	 * the `String`, `Number` or `Boolean` value schema (see `ValueSchema`).
	 * For this to work, it must be possible to resolve the node type by unambiguously matching
	 * a basic TypeScript type of the input data to one of the types allowed by the field,
	 * or, if the field types are undefined, to one of the types available in the global tree schema.
	 * If it's not possible, a `ContextuallyTypedNodeDataObject` with an explicitly provided
	 * type and a value (using a `typeNameSymbol` and a `valueSymbol`) must be used instead.
	 *
	 * Note that currently a setter implementation replaces the nodes and not the field itself,
	 * as this is the only option available in the low-level editing API.
	 * Replacing the nodes has different merge semantics than replacing the field:
	 * it should not overwrite concurrently inserted content while replacing the field should.
	 * This might be changed in the future once the low-level editing API is available.
