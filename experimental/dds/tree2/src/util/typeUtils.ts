 * Use for trick to "inline" generic types.

 * @remarks
 * The TypeScript compiler can be convinced to inline a generic type
 * (so the result of evaluating the generic type show up in IntelliSense and error messages instead of just the invocation of the generic type)
 * by creating an object with a field, and returning the type of that field.
 *
 * For example:
 * ```typescript
 * type MyGeneric<T1, T2> = {x: T1 extends [] ? T1 : T2 };
 * type MyGenericExpanded<T1, T2> = [{x: T1 extends [] ? T1 : T2 }][_InlineTrick]
 *
 * // Type is MyGeneric<5, string>
 * const foo: MyGeneric<5, string> = {x: "x"}
 * // Type is {x: "x"}
 * const foo2: MyGenericExpanded<5, string> = {x: "x"}
 * ```
 *
 * This constant is defined to provide a way to find this documentation from types which use this pattern,
 * and to locate types which use this pattern in case they need updating for compiler changes.

/**
 * Use for trick to prevent self reference error `ts(2456)`.
 *
 * Prefix a type expression with `K extends _RecursiveTrick ? _RecursiveTrick : ` for some K to break the cycle.
 *
 * @remarks
 * The TypeScript compiler handles some cases of recursive types, but not others.
 * Sometimes adding an otherwise needless conditional can make a type compile.
 * Use this type in such cases.
 *
 *For example:
 * ```typescript
 * // The TypeScript compiler can't handle this case
 * type Broken<T> = FlattenKeys<
 *	{
 * 		[K in keyof T]: 0;
 * 	} & {
 * 		[K in keyof T]: Broken<T[K]>;
 * 	}
 * >;
 *
 * // Adding `K extends _RecursiveTrick ? _RecursiveTrick :` makes it compile, and has no effect on the type produced.
 * type Works<T> = FlattenKeys<
 * 	{
 * 		[K in keyof T]: 0;
 * 	} & {
 * 		// Trick added here. Since `k` never extends `never`, the second conditional option is always taken,
 * 		// making this equivalent to the broken version, except this one compiles.
 * 		[K in keyof T]: K extends _RecursiveTrick ? _RecursiveTrick : Works<T[K]>;
 * 	}
 * >;
 * ```
 *
 * This trick appears to start working in TypeScript 4.1 and is confirmed to still work in 5.0.4.
 *
 * This constant is defined to provide a way to find this documentation from types which use this pattern,
 * and to locate types which use this pattern in case they need updating for compiler changes.
