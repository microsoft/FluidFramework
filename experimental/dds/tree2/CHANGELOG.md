## 2.0.0-internal.6.3.0

### Minor Changes

-   Decouple Forest and Schema. ([#17139](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/issues/17139)) [c6b69f5c19](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/c6b69f5c1957ceda7bebe6a31a570b49505e298b)

    Forest no longer exports the schema, nor invalidates when schema changes.

## 2.0.0-internal.6.2.0

### Minor Changes

-   Remove use of @fluidframework/common-definitions ([#16638](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/issues/16638)) [a8c81509c9](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/a8c81509c9bf09cfb2092ebcf7265205f9eb6dbf)

    The **@fluidframework/common-definitions** package is being deprecated, so the following interfaces and types are now
    imported from the **@fluidframework/core-interfaces** package:

    -   interface IDisposable
    -   interface IErrorEvent
    -   interface IErrorEvent
    -   interface IEvent
    -   interface IEventProvider
    -   interface ILoggingError

    -   interface ITelemetryLogger
    -   interface ITelemetryPerformanceEvent
    -   interface ITelemetryProperties
    -   type ExtendEventProvider
    -   type IEventThisPlaceHolder
    -   type IEventTransformer
    -   type ReplaceIEventThisPlaceHolder
    -   type ReplaceIEventThisPlaceHolder
    -   type TelemetryEventCategory
    -   type TelemetryEventPropertyType

## 2.0.0-internal.6.0.0

### Major Changes

-   Upgraded typescript transpilation target to ES2020 [8abce8cdb4](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/8abce8cdb4e2832fb6405fb44e393bef03d5648a)

    Upgraded typescript transpilation target to ES2020. This is done in order to decrease the bundle sizes of Fluid Framework packages. This has provided size improvements across the board for ex. Loader, Driver, Runtime etc. Reduced bundle sizes helps to load lesser code in apps and hence also helps to improve the perf.If any app wants to target any older versions of browsers with which this target version is not compatible, then they can use packages like babel to transpile to a older target.

## 2.0.0-internal.5.4.0

### Minor Changes

-   Remove support for Global Fields ([#16546](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/issues/16546)) [cade66e2fd](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/cade66e2fd55e92109e337ad1801e8751000c2bf)

    Support for Global fields has been removed.

-   Old SchemaBuilder APIs removed ([#16373](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/issues/16373)) [38bcf98635](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/38bcf98635f35c4e0994798e18ae62389da2a773)

    Remove old SchemaBuilder APIs in favor of Schema2 design.

## 2.0.0-internal.5.3.0

### Minor Changes

-   Move closeAndGetPendingLocalState to IContainerExperimental ([#16302](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/issues/16302)) [93151af787](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/93151af787b76e547cf3460df47f81832131db8c)

    This change deprecates the experimental method closeAndGetPendingLocalState on IContainer and moves it to IContainerExperimental.
    IContainerExperimental is an interface that is easily casted to, which enables partners to access experimental features for testing and evaluation.
    Moving the experimental method off IContainer will reduce exposure and churn on that production interface as we iterate on and finalize our experimental features.
    Experimental features should not be used in production environments.

### Major Changes

-   Renamed from `@fluid-internal/tree` to `@fluid-experimental/tree2` so that this package will be included in releases for experimental use.

### Minor Changes

-   Op compression is enabled by default ([#14856](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/pull-requests/14856)) [439c21f31f](https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/commits/439c21f31f4a3ea6515f01d2b2be7f35c04910ce)

    If the size of a batch is larger than 614kb, the ops will be compressed. After upgrading to this version, if batches exceed the size threshold, the runtime will produce a new type of op with the compression properties. To open a document which contains this type of op, the client's runtime version needs to be at least `client_v2.0.0-internal.2.3.0`. Older clients will close with assert `0x3ce` ("Runtime message of unknown type") and will not be able to open the documents until they upgrade. To minimize the risk, it is recommended to audit existing session and ensure that at least 99.9% of them are using a runtime version equal or greater than `client_v2.0.0-internal.2.3.0`, before upgrading to `2.0.0-internal.4.1.0`.

    More information about op compression can be found
    [here](./packages/runtime/container-runtime/src/opLifecycle/README.md).
