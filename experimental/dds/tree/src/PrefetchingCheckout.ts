 * Filter which selects which nodes will be guaranteed to have their payloads available synchronously.

 * Returning `false` indicates that payloads of nodes with the provided definition must are allowed to be provided asynchronously
 * (not prefetched).
 *
 * # Why PrefetchFilter is passed a `Definition`
 *
 * The implementation of PrefetchingCheckout must handle invalidation of PrefetchFilter:
 * if a node is modified in such a way that PrefetchFilter could return a different result, PrefetchFilter must be rerun.
 * This constraint (having to be able to implement invalidation of PrefetchFilter results in PrefetchingCheckout)
 * would be difficult and inefficient to meet if PrefetchFilter could recurse down the tree.
 *
 * PrefetchFilter must however be passed enough information for the domain code to make an informed decision on if the payload should be
 * prefetched.
 * Fortunately, the known use case for this feature, deferred images,
 * has a domain policy about what to prefetch that can be implementable with only the definition:
 * no other data from the node is needed.
 *
 * Given that providing definitions is sufficient (at least for current use-cases),
 * and the other existing types we could provide (ex: Node, SnapshotNodes, NodeId)
 * would require complex and expensive invalidation, the decision was made to simply use `Definition`.
