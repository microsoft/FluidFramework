/**
 * @returns true if two `Payloads` are identical.
 * May return false for equivalent payloads encoded differently.
 *
 * Object field order and object identity are not considered significant, and are ignored by this function.
 * (This is because they may not be preserved through roundtrip).
 *
 * For other information which Fluid would lose on serialization round trip,
 * behavior is unspecified other than this this function is reflective (all payloads are equal to themselves)
 * and commutative (argument order does not matter).
 *
 * This means that any Payload is equal to itself and a deep clone of itself.
 *
 * Payloads might not be equal to a version of themselves that has been serialized then deserialized.
 * If they are serialized then deserialized again, the two deserialized objects will compare equal,
 * however the serialized strings may be unequal (due to field order for objects being unspecified).
 *
 * Fluid will cause lossy operations due to use of JSON.stringify().
 * This includes:
 * - Loss of object identity
 * - Loss of field order (may be ordered arbitrarily)
 * - -0 becomes +0
 * - NaN, Infinity, -Infinity all become null
 * - custom toJSON functions may cause arbitrary behavior
 * - functions become undefined or null
 * - non enumerable properties (including prototype) are lost
 * - more (this is not a complete list)
 *
 * Inputs must not contain cyclic references other than fields set to their immediate parent (for the JavaScript feature detection pattern).
 *
 * IFluidHandle instances (detected via JavaScript feature detection pattern) are only compared by absolutePath.
 *
 * TODO:#54095: Is there a better way to do this comparison?
 * @public
