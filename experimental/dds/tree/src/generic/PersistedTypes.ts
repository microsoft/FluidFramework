// and thus have no impact on serialization as long as the primitive type they are an alias for does not change.
// This does mean that the various UuidString types must remain strings, and must never change the format unless the process for changing
// persisted types (as documented below) is followed.

/**
 * Types for Edits in Fluid Ops and Fluid summaries.
 *
 * Types describing locations in the tree are stable in the presence of other concurrent edits.
 *
 * All types are compatible with Fluid Serializable.
 *
 * These types can only be modified in ways that are both backwards and forwards compatible since they
 * are used in edits, and thus are persisted (using Fluid serialization).
 *
 * This means these types cannot be changed in any way that impacts their Fluid serialization
 * except through a very careful process:
 *
 * 1. The planned change must support all old data, and maintain the exact semantics of it.
 * This means that the change is pretty much limited to adding optional fields,
 * or making required fields optional.
 * 2. Support for the new format must be deployed to all users (This means all applications using SharedTree must do this),
 * and this deployment must be confirmed to be stable and will not be rolled back.
 * 3. Usage of the new format may start.
 *
 * Support for the old format can NEVER be removed: it must be maintained indefinably or old documents will break.
 * Because this process puts requirements on applications using shared tree,
 * step 3 should only ever be done in a Major version update,
 * and must be explicitly called out in the release notes
 * stating which versions of SharedTree are supported for documents modified by the new version.
