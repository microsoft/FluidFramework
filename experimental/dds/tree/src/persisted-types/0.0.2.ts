 * This means that `After` `{undefined}` means the same `Place` as before the first node
 * and `Before` `{undefined}` means the `Place` after the last Node.
 *
 * Each place can be specified, (aka 'anchored') in two ways (relative to the sibling before or after):
 * the choice of which way to anchor a place only matters when the kept across an edit, and thus evaluated in multiple contexts where the
 * two place description may no longer evaluate to the same place.
