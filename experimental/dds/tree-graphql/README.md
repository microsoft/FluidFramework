# @fluid-experimental/tree-graphql

This package demonstrates how graphql codegen might be used to generate resolver functions to read a SharedTree with a given graphql schema.

# Usage

After `npm run refresh` in the repo root, navigate to packages/shared-tree-graphql-prototype and run `npm run codegen`. Then the tests in SharedTreeQuerier.tests.ts can be run.
