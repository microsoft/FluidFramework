# Guidelines for updating this file:
#
# 1. Keep the entries alphabetical wherever possible.
# 2. Be careful when using globs that end with "**". E.g. "packages/**". Doing so can include unexpected packages. This
#    is especially true of packages for which we build ESM and CJS. Such packages sometimes have package.json files in
#    their source or output directories during compilation.

packages:
  - "azure/packages/**"
  - "examples/**"
  - "experimental/**"
  - "packages/**"
  - "tools/markdown-magic"

  # exclude any package.json files that are inside src or output directories
  - "!**/dist/**"
  - "!**/lib/**"
  - "!**/src/**"
