# Please read and understand all of this documentation before modifying this file.
#
# Ownership via this file will block PR until an owner approves. 
# Taking ownership requires a commitment to review all PRs for the selected files.
#
# Lines starting with '#' are comments.
#
# Each line is a file pattern followed by one or more owners.
# More details on the format: https://help.github.com/articles/about-codeowners/
#
# When updating this file, you should also consider updating the GitHub label config in actions-labeler.yml so that
# any area changes are labeled correctly.
#
# ORDER MATTERS! The last matching pattern has the most precedence.
# Be careful not to break existing ownership patterns.
#
# Do not assign ownership to indviduals. Use a Team: https://github.com/orgs/microsoft/teams/fluid-cr/teams
# Using individuals can break processing of this file if they are not contributors, or lose contributors status
# which can and does happen. 
#
# Team maintainers can control how PRs are assigned to their team members. 
# This can be modified under the settings for the team which is only visiable to maintainer.
#
# If you create a new team its parent should be set to fluid-cr, as teams are microsoft wide,
# and we use the parent team to organize them.
