# Please read and understand all of this documentation before modifying this file.
#
# Ownership via this file will block PR until an owner approves.
# Taking ownership requires a commitment to review all PRs for the selected files.
#
# Lines starting with '#' are comments.
#
# Each line is a file pattern followed by one or more owners.
# More details on the format: https://help.github.com/articles/about-codeowners/
#
# When updating this file, you should also consider updating the GitHub label config in actions-labeler.yml so that
# any area changes are labeled correctly.
#
# ORDER MATTERS! The last matching pattern has the most precedence.
# Be careful not to break existing ownership patterns.
#
# Do not assign ownership to indviduals. Use a Team: https://github.com/orgs/microsoft/teams/fluid-cr/teams .
# Using individuals can break processing of this file if they are not contributors, or lose contributors status
# which can and does happen. Use "function/area-based" teams rather than "organization-based" teams and add
# individuals to each one; we use fluid-cr and its child teams (by convention named fluid-cr-<some-specifier>)
# for this. One reason is that teams in Github cannot have multiple parents, i.e. they cannot be members of more
# than one other team, so trying to reuse org-based teams to have the same people be reviewers of different areas
# doesn't work.
#
# Team maintainers can control how PRs are assigned to their team members.
# This can be modified under the settings for the team which is only visiable to maintainer.
#
# If you create a new team its parent should be set to fluid-cr, as teams are microsoft wide,
# and we use the parent team to organize them.

# Package version files are not generally interesting to review by teams signing up for source tree ownership.
# If a release team wanted to sign up to block on changes relevant for package release,
# that would be the appropriate owner here. For now, explicitly give these files no owner.
