# When a release tag is pushed to the repo, this workflow is triggered. It first installs the Fluid build-tools, then
# uses the flub release fromTag command to load some release metadata into an environment variable. Once loaded, it
# checks out the tagged commit and runs flub release report to generate release reports. It also uses auto-changelog to
# create a changelog for patch releases (only patches). All the artifacts are uploaded for debugging purposes.

# Once the artifacts are created, the workflow creates a GitHub release and attaches the release reports to it. The
# release is a draft so that the release engineer can verify the contents before publishing.
