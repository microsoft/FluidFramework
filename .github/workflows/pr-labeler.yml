    # Skip labeling main-next merge PRs. The area labels are noisy and distracting for main-next PRs because they can
    # contain many commits, and thus touch nearly the whole repo in a single commit. Skipping these labels makes it
    # easier to focus on the more relevant main-next labels.
    #
    # This is implemented by comparing the PR title because at creation time, the PR has no labels (and the GItHub API
    # does not have a way to set labels at creation either), so skipping based on labels does not work.
