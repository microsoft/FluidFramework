# release-branches.yml
#
# Checks if a PR is targeting a client or server release branch or not, and uploads a CI artifact containing the
# results, along with the PR number. This allows downstream workflows, such as release-approval, to be triggered by the
# completion of this workflow and take further action based on the target branch.
