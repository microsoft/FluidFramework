name: "pr-check-changeset"

# This workflow checks PRs for the presence of a new changeset file. When a PR is opened, it will be checked for a
# changeset. The results of the check are uploaded as a pipeline artifact. After this workflow is completed it triggers
# the changeset-reporter workflow, which adds a comment to the PR depending on the results of the check.
#
# The workflows are separated for security reasons. This workflow does not require write access to the repo, but the
# changeset-reporter workflow does.
