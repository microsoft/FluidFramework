  # This job determines what paths have changed in the PR and outputs a boolean. Using the paths filter in the
  # pull_request event doesn't work. Per the GitHub docs, "If a workflow is skipped due to path filtering, branch
  # filtering or a commit message, then checks associated with that workflow will remain in a 'Pending' state. A pull
  # request that requires those checks to be successful will be blocked from merging." This means we can't make such
  # jobs required for PRs to be merged, because the jobs just stay in the pending state.
