## Property Details {#properties-details}

### cancel {#cancel-PropertySignature}

Abort signal used to cancel operation Note that most of the layers do not use this signal yet. We need to change that over time. Please consult with API documentation / implementation. Note that number of layers may not check this signal while holding this request in a queue, so it may take a while it takes effect. This can be improved in the future.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
cancel?: AbortSignal;
```

## Method Details {#methods-details}

### onRetry {#onretry-MethodSignature}

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
onRetry?(delayInMs: number, error: any): void;
```
