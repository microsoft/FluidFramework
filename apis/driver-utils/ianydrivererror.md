Interface describing errors and warnings raised by any driver code. Not expected to be implemented by a class or an object literal, but rather used in place of any or unknown in various function signatures that pass errors around.

"Any" in the interface name is a nod to the fact that errorType has lost its type constraint. It will be either DriverErrorType or the specific driver's specialized error type enum, but we can't reference a specific driver's error type enum in this code.
