{{% callout Warning Deprecated %}}
It is recommended not to bundle view code with Fluid data, and instead apply the views from outside the container (see https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/tree/main/examples/hosts/app-integration/external-views for an example of this approach). For those views, a dedicated view framework is recommended (see view sampler demo https://github.com/microsoft/FluidFramework/tree/main/examples/apps/view-framework-sampler)

An IFluidHTMLView is a renderable object, which may or may not also be its own model. If it is its own model, it is a "thick" view, otherwise it is a "thin" view.

        Views which need to perform cleanup (e.g. remove event listeners, timers, etc.) when removed from the DOM should implement remove() and perform that cleanup within. Fluid Objects which wish to remove views from the DOM should call remove() on the view before removing it from the DOM.

        Render the view into an HTML element. In the case of Block display, elm.getBoundingClientRect() defines the dimensions of the viewport in which to render. Typically, this means that elm should already be placed into the DOM. If elm has an empty client rect, then it is assumed that it will expand to hold the rendered view.

## Method Details

### remove {#remove-methodsignature}

{{% callout Warning Deprecated %}}
See [IFluidHTMLView](/docs/apis/view-interfaces\ifluidhtmlview-interface)


{{% /callout %}}

Views which need to perform cleanup (e.g. remove event listeners, timers, etc.) when removed from the DOM should implement remove() and perform that cleanup within. Fluid Objects which wish to remove views from the DOM should call remove() on the view before removing it from the DOM.

#### Signature {#remove-signature}

```typescript
remove?(): void;
```

### render {#render-methodsignature}

{{% callout Warning Deprecated %}}
See [IFluidHTMLView](/docs/apis/view-interfaces\ifluidhtmlview-interface)


{{% /callout %}}

Render the view into an HTML element. In the case of Block display, elm.getBoundingClientRect() defines the dimensions of the viewport in which to render. Typically, this means that elm should already be placed into the DOM. If elm has an empty client rect, then it is assumed that it will expand to hold the rendered view.

#### Signature {#render-signature}

```typescript
render(elm: HTMLElement, options?: IFluidHTMLOptions): void;
```
