## Property Details

### localRemovedSeq {#localremovedseq-propertysignature}

Local seq at which this segment was removed, if the removal is yet-to-be acked.

#### Signature {#localremovedseq-signature}

```typescript
localRemovedSeq?: number;
```

### removedClientIds {#removedclientids-propertysignature}

List of client IDs that have removed this segment. The client that actually removed the segment (i.e. whose removal op was sequenced first) is stored as the first client in this list. Other clients in the list have all issued concurrent ops to remove the segment.

#### Signature {#removedclientids-signature}

```typescript
removedClientIds: number[];
```

#### Remarks {#removedclientids-remarks}

When this list has length &gt; 1, this is referred to as the "overlapping remove" case.

### removedSeq {#removedseq-propertysignature}

Seq at which this segment was removed.

#### Signature {#removedseq-signature}

```typescript
removedSeq: number;
```
