An IPactMap is a key-value storage, in which setting a value is done via a proposal system. All collaborators who were connected at the time of the proposal must accept the change before it is considered accepted (or, if those clients disconnect they are considered to have implicitly accepted). As a result, the value goes through two phases: 1. "pending" state where the proposal has been sequenced, but there are still outstanding acceptances 2. "accepted" state where all clients who were connected at the time the proposal was made have either accepted or disconnected.
