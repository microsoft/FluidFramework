## Property Details {#properties-details}

### batchSize {#batchsize-PropertySignature}

Batch size. Controls how many ops are grouped together as single cache entry The bigger the number, the more efficient it is (less reads &amp; writes) At the same time, big number means we wait for so many ops to accumulate, which increases chances and number of trailing ops that would not be flushed to cache when user closes tab Use any number below 1 to disable caching Default: 100

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
batchSize?: number;
```

### timerGranularity {#timergranularity-PropertySignature}

To reduce the problem of losing trailing ops when using big batch sizes, host could specify how often driver should flush ops it has not flushed yet. -1 means do not use timer. Measured in ms. Default: 5000

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
timerGranularity?: number;
```

### totalOpsToCache {#totalopstocache-PropertySignature}

Total number of ops to cache. When we reach that number, ops caching stops Default: 5000

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
totalOpsToCache?: number;
```
