    <tr>
      <td><a href='/docs/apis/shared-summary-block/isharedsummaryblock'>ISharedSummaryBlock</a></td>
      <td>Shared summary block interface. A shared summary block is part of the summary but it does not generate any ops. The set on this interface must only be called in response to a remote op. Basically, if we replay same ops, the set of calls on this interface to set data should be the same. This is critical because the object does not generate ops of its own, but relies on the above principle to maintain eventual consistency and to summarize.</td>
