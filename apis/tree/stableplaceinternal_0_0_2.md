A location in a trait. This is NOT the location of a node, but a location where a node could be inserted: it is next to a sibling or at one end of the trait.

To be well formed, either `sibling` or `trait` must be defined, but not both.

Any given insertion location can be described by two `StablePlace` objects, one with `Side.After` and one with `Side.Before`<!-- -->. For example, in a trait containing two strings "foo" and "bar", there are 6 different `StablePlace`<!-- -->s corresponding to 3 locations in the trait a new node could be inserted: at the start, before "foo", after "foo", before "bar", after "bar", and at the end. Neither of the two ways to specify the same location are considered to be after each other.

The anchor (`referenceSibling` or `referenceTrait`<!-- -->) used for a particular `StablePlace` can have an impact in collaborative scenarios.

`StablePlace` objects can be conveniently constructed with the helper methods exported on a constant of the same name.

## Property Details {#properties-details}

### referenceSibling {#referencesibling-PropertySignature}

The sibling to which this 'StablePlace' is anchored (by 'side'). If specified, referenceTrait must be unspecified.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
readonly referenceSibling?: StableNodeId;
```

### referenceTrait {#referencetrait-PropertySignature}

The trait to which this 'StablePlace' is anchored (by 'side'). If specified, referenceSibling must be unspecified.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
readonly referenceTrait?: TraitLocationInternal_0_0_2;
```

### side {#side-PropertySignature}

Where this StablePlace is relative to the sibling (if specified), or an end of the trait (if no sibling specified). If 'After' and there is no sibling, this StablePlace is after the front of the trait. If 'Before' and there is no sibling, this StablePlace is before the back of the trait.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
readonly side: Side;
```
