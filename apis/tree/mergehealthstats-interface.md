### rangeConstraintViolationCount {#rangeconstraintviolationcount-propertysignature}

### updatedRangeBadPlaceCount {#updatedrangebadplacecount-propertysignature}

### updatedRangeInvertedCount {#updatedrangeinvertedcount-propertysignature}

Number of sequenced edits that failed to apply due to a range whose places were resolvable but inverted (i.e., end before start). Such cases are also counted under [MergeHealthStats.badRangeCount](/docs/apis/tree\mergehealthstats-interface#badrangecount-propertysignature)<!-- -->.
