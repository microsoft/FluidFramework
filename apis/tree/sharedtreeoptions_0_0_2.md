## Property Details {#properties-details}

### summarizeHistory {#summarizehistory-PropertySignature}

Determines if the history is included in summaries.

Warning: enabling history summarization incurs a permanent cost in the document. It is not possible to disable history summarization later once it has been enabled, and thus the history cannot be safely deleted.

On 0.1.1 documents, due to current code limitations, this parameter is only impactful for newly created documents. `SharedTree`<!-- -->s which load existing documents will summarize history if and only if the loaded summary included history.

The technical limitations here relate to clients with mixed versions collaborating. In the future we may allow modification of whether or not a particular document saves history, but only via a consensus mechanism. See the skipped test in SharedTreeFuzzTests.ts for more details on this issue. See docs/Breaking-Change-Migration for more details on the consensus scheme.
